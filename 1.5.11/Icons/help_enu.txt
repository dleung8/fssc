Keywords: User Interface, User Interface\Editor, Editor, Quick Reference

FS Scenery Creator provides an intuitive point-and-click interface for creating and placing objects. However, if you need some help, this page will point out the steps to perform the basic tasks of scenery design.

To add an object:
Right-click on the editor where you want to add a new object. Select the desired object to add.

To select an object:
Left-click on the object's focus circle.

To select an obscured object:
Hold the Shift key, then left-click on the object's focus circle.

To select multiple objects:
Hold the Ctrl key while left-clicking on the desired objects. Left-click again on an object to unselect an object.

To select multiple objects within a rectangular region:
Click and hold down the left mouse button to drag a rectangular grid on the editor. Release the button when the desired objects fall within the rectangle.

To recenter the editor:
Double-click at the desired center point on the editor.

To move around the editor:
1) Use the scrollbars on the bottom and right edges of the screen, 2) use the mousewheels to move vertically (hold down the Shift key to move horizontally), or 3) hold your mouse down at any edge of the screen as if you were dragging or gridding to scroll the screen in that direction at short intervals.

To rescale the editor:
Use the zoom buttons on the toolbar, the plus/minus (+/–) keys on your keyboard, or use the zoom to fit feature: click and drag a selection rectangle around the region of interest, and press the plus (+) key on the keyboard before releasing the mouse button.

To find out an object's name and position:
Hover the mouse cursor above the object's focus circle.

To move objects around graphically:
Left-click the mouse button and drag the object to the new location before releasing the mouse button. Drag multiple objects by selecting them, and then using the previous technique on any of the selected objects.

To edit an object's (or objects') properties:
Select the object, and then press F4, or right-click the object and select Properties. If multiple objects are under the mouse cursor, select the desired object from the list of choices.

To insert a point in a <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\road.html">road</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\river.html">river</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\line.html">line</A>, or <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat area</A>:
Click on any line of the object and drag the newly created point to the desired position.

Title: Units of Measure
Level: 3
Keywords: User Interface, User Interface\Units of Measure, Units of Measure

FS Scenery Creator version 1.5 features a powerful, but easy to use units interface for the scenery designer. Most text fields now have their unit of measure editable right in the field itself. When a property page is first displayed, each text field has its numeric value and the unit of measure shown in its abbreviation. The unit shown is usually the default length unit set in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences window</A>. When changing a field, you can also change the unit of measure if desired, and FS Scenery Creator will apply the necessary conversions when you press the OK button. If no unit is present, the default unit is assumed.

You can use the following suffixes to qualify the numeric value of a text field in the English version of FS Scenery Creator:.

Length:
m (meters), ft (feet), mi (miles), km (kilometers), nm (nautical miles)

Rotation:
°geo (geographic heading), °mag (magnetic heading)

File: reference\objects\runway.html
Title: Runway Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Runway

The runway is the basic scenery element of flight simulation and defines the airport. Most, if not all, sceneries that you will design will involve placing one or more runways.

There are several properties that are specific to each end of the runway. For scenery design purposes, the near end of the runway is defined to be the direction that is set in the Properties tab, and the far end is the reverse end of the runway. The instrument landing system (ILS) can also be set for each end of the runway.

File: reference\objects\polygon.html
Title: Polygon Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Polygon

The polygon defines the texture of the ground. A polygon may be associated with a <A HREF="reference\properties\texture.html">texture</A> or a <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A>. The sides may optionally be dotted with lights, and you can even define a plateau by linking a polygon with another polygon that will serve as the base of the plateau. With this information, FS Scenery Creator can extrapolate the slope of the hill. This technique, however, does not define a landing area for an airplane. To do this, see the topic on <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat areas</A>.

Polygons are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\taxiway.html
Title: Taxiway Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Taxiway

The taxiway links a runway to the terminal. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a taxiway by a series of connected points. For advanced users, it may be somewhat beneficial for speed in using the discontinuity property (see <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">point object</A>) to design an entire airport's taxiway network with one taxiway object. Taxiways may optionally be lined with blue lights, and have a centerline. For greater control over the placement of taxiways, designers have used a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">polygon</A> with dotted blue lights to simulate a taxiway.

Taxiways are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\road.html
Title: Road Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Road

Roads in Flight Simulator are for decorative purposes only. Its usage in FS Scenery Creator is similar to a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a road by a series of connected points. Roads may optionally be filled with moving car lights at night.

Roads are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\river.html
Title: River Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\River

Using a river in FS Scenery Creator is virtually the same as using a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>. Please see that topic for details.

Rivers are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\line.html
Title: Line Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Line

At its most basic function, the line object draws a line in the Flight Simulator world. This can be used to define taxiway centerlines, or elevated power lines. However, the most powerful feature of the line is that you can link a <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> or a <A HREF="reference\objects\macro.html">macro</A> with a line, and have the linked object be repeated at regular intervals. To do this, simply select an object from the list and type in a spacing factor.

Lines are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\building.html
Title: Building Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Building

The building can be used to make houses, office buildings, or airport terminals. Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, you can use the advanced building style to mix and match many different textures. An advanced building has 4 different levels: the lobby, the floors, the penthouse, and the roof, and each level can be customized in terms of height, texture, and texture stretching factor. You can preview the textures and the scaling that you've chosen using the building editor.

Besides the default four-sided flat roof style, you can also choose the pyramid, sloped, or n-sided styles.

File: reference\objects\macro.html
Title: Macro Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Macro, Objects\Include, Include

The macro is able to extend FS Scenery Creator beyond its predefined objects. Macros are developed by hobbyists around the world, and usually come in one of several standard formats which can be read by FS Scenery Creator. A macro is usually a complex object with intricate textures and shapes; for example, a tree, a building, or an airplane. They may provide parameters that can be used to customize the object (such as the <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A> or the dimensions of the object). These can be set in the third tab of the Macro property page.

Because the use of "includes" is obsolete, FS Scenery Creator does not provide direct support for them. However, if you do have occasion to use one, simply use the macro object with the file name of the include. The include will simply ignore any parameters passed into it.

File: reference\objects\atis.html
Title: ATIS Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\ATIS

An ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information System) sends out information regarding flight conditions around an airport. The text is limited to 255 characters. Several escape sequences are available to shorten the message to within the allowable limit, or to insert actual weather conditions. These sequences are available by clicking the Insert button under the text field.

File: reference\objects\vor.html
Title: VOR Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\VOR

A VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) is a beacon used in aircraft navigation. To learn more about VORs, consult the Flight Simulator handbook.

If the Facility Entry box is checked, information about the VOR will be entered into the Airport and Facility Directory database which includes the GPS map view.

File: reference\objects\ndb.html
Title: NDB Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\NDB

An NDB (Non-Directional Radio Beacon) is a beacon used in aircraft navigation. To learn more about NDBs, consult the Flight Simulator handbook.

If the Facility Entry box is checked, information about the NDB will be entered into the Airport and Facility Directory database which includes the GPS map view.

File: reference\objects\menuentry.html
Title: Menu Entry Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Menu Entry

The menu entry object positions aircraft at specific points inside your scenery. The entries created by the Menu Entry object will appear in the "Scenery 6.0 and before" section of the Airport and Facility Directory in Flight Simulator.

Alternatively, you can also provide starting locations for your airport in the FS98/FS2000 Airport and Facility Directory. In the Runway property page, check "Airport Facility Entry", and starting locations for both ends of the runways will be automatically created for you.

File: reference\objects\background.html
Title: Background Image Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Background Image

A background image allows you to overlay image files over the editor to get an accurate placement of objects, or when the visible property is checked, it allows you to place the image as-is in the Flight Simulator world.

To place the image accurately, you must either have the scale of the image in meters per pixel (or some other compatible distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">unit</A>) or the coordinates of two opposite corners and the rotation of the image.

<B>Note:</B> If you are placing a visible bitmap, FS Scenery Creator may generate a converted bitmap in the destination texture directory in a format compatible with Flight Simulator. If you are redistributing your scenery, be sure to include this file.

File: reference\objects\flatarea.html
Title: Flat Area Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Flat Area

A flat area defines a level surface for your airport, and is a must for any airfield that is not already defined in some way in the Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2 default world. For Flight Simulator 98, Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, use <A HREF="reference\scenery.html">Synthetic Scenery</A>. For Flight Simulator 2002, you use a Flat Area to set the desired altitude, and a <A HREF="reference\objects\surfacearea.html">Surface Area</A> in addition to the flat area if the scenery area was a body of water in the default scenery.

Choose from two different ways to flatten your scenery:.

<UL>
<LI><B>Flatten Switch (scenery.cfg):</B> These are several lines of instructions in the FS\scenery.cfg file that tell Flight Simulator to flatten a given area. This method is limited to 1 flat area per scenery area. Unless there is a good reason to do so, use the Area16N method instead.
<LI><B>Area16N:</B> This is the recommended method for Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2. A separate BGL file is generated with the flat area commands and there are no practical limitations on the number and the size of each flat area. Each flat area is surrounded by slopes to blend in with the surrounding altitudes.
</UL>

Flat Areas are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\surfacearea.html
Title: Surface Area Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Surface Area

A surface area can either define a platform (such as those for helipads), or the ground type (runway, grass, water). For designing airports that do not exist in the Flight Simulator 2002 default world, you must use a Surface Area with "Smooth" type to have the area landable.

File: reference\objects\exclusion.html
Title: Exclusion Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Exclusion

The exclusion object is used to eliminate scenery elements of an underlying scenery. If there is an existing airfield in the default Flight Simulator world that you are trying to rebuild, use the exclusion object to delete those objects so that they don't show through on your scenery.

File: reference\objects\code.html
Title: SCASM Code Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\SCASM Code

The SCASM code object is used to write raw code in the Scenery Assembler language in FS Scenery Creator. This object is present to provide the import feature with a default object, and is rarely used in actual scenery design. The documentation for the SCASM language is given in the FSSC\Scasm subfolder.

File: reference\objects\point.html
Title: Point Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Point

The Point defines the shape of a parent object which includes the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\road.html">road</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\river.html">river</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\line.html">line</A>, and <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat area</A>.

Besides the <A HREF="reference\properties\position.html">position</A> properties, the point also has a type property. The following choices may not be present for certain types of objects:.

<UL>
<LI><B>Visible:</B> A line (or taxiway, etc.) is drawn to the next point.
<LI><B>Invisible:</B> A discontinuity exists between the point and the next point, i.e. no line is drawn.
<LI><B>Dotted:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals to the next point.
<LI><B>Taxiway:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals along this edge of the polygon.
</UL>

Points can be created by clicking on a line of the parent object that you want to create a point in, or by pressing the Insert key. Points are deleted using the Delete key, or by using the Delete option from the <A HREF="ui\menus\edit.html">Edit menu</A>. If the number of points fall below the allowable limit, the parent object is automatically deleted for you.

The maximum number of points that can be created are: 80 for Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, 2000 for Flight Simulator 2000 and above, and 30 for a Flat Area that uses a flatten switch.

Keywords: Properties

The following pages describe properties of some <A HREF="reference\objects\index.html">objects</A> in detail. To get help on other properties that are not in this section, simply click the <img src="images/help.gif"> button at the upper right hand corner of any window, and then clicking on the item of interest.

File: reference\properties\position.html
Title: Position Properties (X/Y, and Latitude/Longitude)
Level: 4
Properties\Position
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Position, Position, X/Y, Latitude/Longitude

The position properties determine where the object is placed in the world. There are two ways to locate an object: either by describing the distance from a reference point (the X and Y properties) or by an absolute position (the latitude and longitude properties). Both sets of properties can be used in FS Scenery Creator.

The X and Y values can be entered in any distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">units</A> and are relative to the scenery center point.

The latitude and longitude values can be entered in decimal format (which is the more accurate of the two), or the fractional minutes format which is the default format used in Flight Simulator. You can, however, change this setting in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>, and the change will be reflected the next time you start Flight Simulator. Regardless of the current setting, FS Scenery Creator can detect and convert either format into X/Y values.

Graphically, you can change the positional properties by dragging an object around the editor. The current position of your mouse is displayed in the statusbar in both X/Y and Latitude/Longitude form.

File: reference\properties\rotation.html
Title: Rotation
Level: 4
Properties\Rotation
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Rotation, Rotation, Heading

Rotation (called heading in previous versions of FS Scenery Creator) determines the orientation of an object. It is only available in some objects such as the building and the runway. Because the magnetic rotation value of the same physical direction may vary from year to year, FS Scenery Creator stores all rotations in the geographic measurement which is fixed. (However, you can set FS Scenery Creator to display rotations in magnetic form in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>). As discussed in the <A HREF="ui\units.html">units of measure</A> topic, you can enter rotations in either format.

<B>Note:</B> FS Scenery Creator uses the magnetic variation table of the currently selected Flight Simulator version to determine the geographic to magnetic conversions.

File: reference\properties\color.html
Title: Color
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Color, Color

While texturing has gained much more importance in the past few years as graphics engines have become much faster, colors are still an important part of the scenery. FS Scenery Creator provides a large palette of colors that can be accessed from the property pages of objects that support it. You may choose from the basic colors, or the night-illuminated colors supported in all versions of Flight Simulator, or if you are designing for Flight Simulator 2000 or higher, you can specify any red-green-blue color to generate one of more than 16 million colors. You can also choose from 16 levels of transparency (from clear to opaque) to control shading, and you can make any color (not just the night palette colors) night persistent.

File: reference\properties\texture.html
Title: Texture
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Texture, Texture

Textures fill and shade most of the Flight Simulator world. Most objects use some form of texturing to decorate the object. In FS Scenery Creator, you can choose from a set list of textures for some objects, such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> and <A HREF="reference\objects\runway.html">runway</A> objects, or from a list of textures on your file system such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A> object.

Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, different textures can be used for different times of the day, and for different seasons. These textures need to be named in a special naming convention so that they can be detected by Flight Simulator. The following list summarizes the naming convention:.

<UL>
<LI>Normal: base.bmp
<LI>Night: base_LM.bmp
<LI>Spring: base_SP.bmp
<LI>Fall: base_FA.bmp
<LI>Winter: base_WI.bmp
<LI>Hard winter: base_HW.bmp
</UL>

Unfortunately, most bitmaps cannot be used as-is by Flight Simulator, and must first be processed by a bitmap editing program such as BMP2000, DxtBMP, or Microsoft's ImageTool.

<H5>Getting acquainted</H5>

If FS Scenery Creator is not open, start the program: Click on your Start Menu, highlight the Programs folder, find Leung Software, and click on FS Scenery Creator.

Welcome to FS Scenery Creator! After the program has loaded, you will see the main editor window. Below the title bar, you will find the menus you use to access various features. Below the menu bar is the toolbar which provides shortcuts for frequently used features.

On the bottom of the window, you will find the statusbar. When the mouse is over the editor, the statusbar contains the current position of the mouse in world coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the relative position from the reference point (horizontal and vertical distance). It will also show the name of the object that the mouse is currently hovering over.

Title: Working with FS Scenery Creator: Lesson 2

<H5>Objects</H5>

Between the toolbar and the status bar is the editor. When you start a new scenery, the editor consists of gridlines spaced 1 kilometer apart horizontally and vertically. If you right-click on the editor, you will be presented with the Editor menu which allows you to add objects. (Alternatively, you can press the Menu key, or Shift+F10)

Like many computer-aided design applications, FS Scenery Creator uses the object system. Each scenery element (such as a building or a runway) is an object, and all objects have at least the X and Y property which tells the program where to draw the object. Each object also has a circle around its selection area where you can left-click to select the object. When selected, this circle is bright blue.

When you click another object, the previous object loses focus. If you want to select multiple objects, hold the Ctrl key down when clicking. Alternatively, if you click where there are no objects and drag a rectangle, the objects within the rectangle are selected for you.

<H5>Properties</H5>

Once an object is selected, you can edit its properties. A right-click will bring up the menu (as a shortcut, you can right click on an object to select it and bring up the Editor menu at the same time), and below the Add Objects options, you will find a list of objects that are selected. Selecting one of these will bring up its property page. When multiple objects are selected, there will also be a "Properties" option where you can collectively edit the properties of all the items. Depending on the type of objects selected, you may be presented with a specialized property page, or a generic page where you can only edit the position properties.

If you want to change the position of selected objects, just click on any of the selected object and drag them to the new location. All of the other selected objects will move the same distance. A new feature of FS Scenery Creator is that if you drag objects near the edge of the screen, the program will automatically scroll the editor at small intervals. (This will also happen when you are making a selection rectangle.)

You can use the following shortcut keys. Pressing F4 will open up the selected object's property page with the first tab selected. F5 will open up the page with the second tab selected, and F6, F7, and F8 will open up the page with the third, fourth, and fifth tab selected respectively. If multiple objects are selected, the multiple objects property page will be shown.

<H5>Moving around</H5>

You can move around the editor in several ways. To recenter the editor, double click at the new center point. To move at small intervals, you can use the scrollbars at the right and bottom of the editor, or use the mousewheels (roll normally to move vertically, or hold the shift button to move horizontally). If you have the left mouse button down (for gridding or dragging), the editor will scroll if the mouse is at one of the edges.

FS Scenery Creator can draw your screen at different zoom levels. Simply click the plus or minus buttons at the top of the screen to zoom in and out. Alternatively use the plus (+) or minus (-) key on the keyboard. You can also zoom in at a specific region by dragging a selection rectangle around the area of interest, and then pressing the plus (+) key before releasing the mouse button.
