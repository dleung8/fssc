<P><H4>Version 1.2.0-1.2.5 (December 11, 2000 - February 9, 2001):</H4></P>

<P>Note: Versions 1.2.0 through 1.2.4 were non-public beta releases. This list only contains the fixes for bugs in version 1.1.9, and the new features developed in version 1.2.0 or during the beta test period and not the bugs that were in the beta versions. Many thanks to the beta testers.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed: There was a slight miscalculation in all the older versions: though the default scale is 4 meters per pixel, and the zoom in/out doubles or halves the scale value, the scale value was something closer to 3.9, and thus the X/Y values were not whole numbers.
<LI>Fixed: Runway lights options were written incorrectly for Flight Simulator 2000 runways.
<LI>New: SCASM now included as the Scenery compiler.
<LI>New: More macros bundled.
<LI>New: FS Scenery Creator is now in several more languages: French, Spanish, German, and Polish.
<LI>New: Ability to place objects using Latitude/Longitude.
<LI>New: Ability to orient objects using true or magnetic heading.
<LI>New: Choice of metric or standard measurements. Changes meters to feet or vice versa. However, since FS Scenery Creator stores measurements internally as metric, and some measurements are in integers, some values may be rounded slightly. (Example: 35 feet -> 11 meters -> 36 feet.)
<LI>New: Polygons can now be filled with the polygon color. Taxiways, Roads, Rivers, and lines can be drawn with thick lines (as wide as the width you specify). These features can be turned off in the Options dialog box.
<LI>New: Airport and Facilities Directory support. You have the option to put Airport, VOR, and NDB information in the FS98/FS2000 AFD format by selecting the check box in the respective objects, and by setting the Scenery location in the Header properties box. AFD code is generated in a separate source file: filename_AFD.sca. The first ATIS of your Scenery will be used as the frequency of the airport. You have the option to compile AFD data in the File menu.
<LI>New: A new object, the Flat area allows you to flatten Scenery (for FS2000 only). You can choose to use flatten switches, or the Area16N command. However, only the first flat area using flatten switches is processed; all other flat areas using flatten switches are ignored. There is no limitation for Area16N's. Note: Flatten areas in older versions are not loaded into FSSC 1.2. They will be loaded as regular polygons. Area16N's are generated in a separate source file: filename_A16N.sca. FS Scenery Creator will automatically compile this file.
<LI>New: Ability to select up to three macro directories in the Options dialog box in addition to the default "FS Scenery Creator\Macros" directory. All API macros found in these directories will be listed in the macro object selection box. The file list is created the first time and then cached.
<LI>New: A better macro drawing algorithm. FS Scenery Creator now reads TexPolys and Poly commands. More macros should be drawn accurately in this version than in the last.
<LI>New: Ability to name objects. All objects can now be named (The Airport files import process is appropriately changed to reflect this new feature). If no name is specified, the default name will be used. This feature has no reflection on the compiled SCASM code, but some users may find it helpful for organizational purposes.
<LI>New: More options for FS2000 runways such as red-ended centerlines, and threshold zone lights, and ability to place the VASI/PAPI on both sides of the runway.
<LI>New: Runways can now be placed either with the specified position being the center of the runway, or the near end of the runway.
<LI>New: Ability to change the placement of the VASI/PAPI.
<LI>New: Updated import functionality for Airport files saved by builds 82/89.
<LI>New: Taxiway centerlines, and line objects can now be more than 1 meter wide. However, dotted lines that are more than 1 meter thick will be ignored, and treated as "Skip to" lines. Appropriately, now you can click on the entire thickness of the line to create new points.
<LI>New: Objects list now integrated into the editor. Selecting "Objects" from the Scenery menu will open up a second pane in the main screen. All changes made in one pane will be reflected in the other. You can resize and dock the panel either on the right or left side.
<LI>New: Multiple background images. The background image is now an object. This change allows you to drag your bitmap to any position like any other object. Backgrounds will always be drawn below any other object in the editor, but you can still use the Bring To Front, Send To Back commands to control which image overlaps which ones.
<LI>New: Optional prompt to save before compilation.
<LI>New: Autosave file feature enables FS Scenery Creator to save your file to a temporary location (C:\Windows\Temp) every several minutes. If FS Scenery Creator terminates normally, these files are deleted.
<LI>New: Ability to specify a zoom level manually between 0.01 and 64 meters. (Note, there is a problem with drawing polygon lines at very small scales which is inherent in how Windows draws them. The polygon fill feature is also disabled for 0.0625 meters per pixel and smaller because of this same problem.
<LI>New: Ability to measure the distance between two points on the editor. Simply click and hold the mouse button at the first point, and drag to the second point. The statusbar will show you the distance of the diagonal of the gridding box. Hit the Esc key to abort the multi-select.
<LI>New: Objects can now be locked into place, locked objects cannot be dragged in the editor.
<LI>New: Polygons, Taxiways, Roads, Rivers, and Lines can now optionally be locked so that additional points cannot be created.
<LI>New: Default button in the Options dialog box allows you to revert to the standard settings.
<LI>New: The Bring to Front/Send to Back command now works with points. Selecting either of these commands will bring to front/send to back the entire shape. This should lessen the need to use layers, which slow down Flight Simulator's graphics engine.
<LI>New: Ability to transform (shift and rotate) selected objects (or the entire Scenery).
<LI>New: The delete command now selects the next object after operation, so you can press Del multiple times. Note: because of the way objects are stored by FSSC, the next object may not be the next point of the polygon.
<LI>New: Support for mouse wheel. To scroll up or down the editor, roll your mouse wheel up or down. To scroll sideways, hold the shift key: mouse wheel up scrolls to the left and mouse wheel down scrolls to the right.

<LI>New: FS Scenery Creator now utilizes the standard Windows Installer which should eliminate installation problems. (Actually, this caused more problems than it solved. This feature was withdrawn in later versions.)
<LI>New: FS Scenery Creator now utilizes the new HTML help format.
</UL>

<P><H4>Version 1.1.3 (September 25, 2000):</H4></P>

<P><H4>Version 1.0.1 (June 7, 2000):</H4></P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed: FS Scenery Creator used the local decimal separator settings when writing numbers for the Scenery compiler. Instead, it should always use the period.
<LI>Fixed: In fractional minutes mode, the statusbar occasionally read "W023.031.00" instead of "W023.04.00" due to rounding errors.
<LI>Fixed: The labels for the near and far end of the runway dialog box used to reset to 36/18 when the properties dialog box is invoked subsequently.

<LI>Fixed: Selecting SCASM source file format in Export incorrectly compiled the file to BGL format.
<LI>Fixed: FS Scenery Creator always read from FLTSIM98.CFG file, the FS98 configuration file regardless of the version of Flight Simulator that is installed. FS Scenery Creator should read from the correct Flight Simulator configuration file (2000, 98, 95) for "Fractional Minutes", or store its own internal value if none of the configuration files are found.
<LI>Fixed: FS Scenery Creator created a blank magdec.bgl, the magnetic deviation information provided by Flight Simulator, if the file did not exist. It should not create a blank file.
<LI>Fixed: FS Scenery Creator printed blank spaces for macro parameters that are left blank. It should instead write "0" for unused parameters for macros as place holders.
<LI>New: Scenery/Header dialog box prompts for fractional minutes for Scenery center when the option to display fractional minutes is checked.
<LI>New: Export toolbar button.
<LI>New: FS Scenery Creator can display a background picture to facilitate placing objects.
<LI>New: Fuel area now features a standard fuel pump if desired.
<LI>New: Dotted lines are now available by creating a line, and selecting "Dotted line" for each point in the line.
<LI>New: Less crowded Locations Tab in Options dialog box contains two new entries: Export folder and Texture folder.
<LI>New: Files created by FS Scenery Creator 1.0.0 (Beta 1) are compatible with version 1.0.1. However, files saved in 1.0.1 format will not be compatible with 1.0.0.
<LI>New: Roads are now created with the asphalt.r8 texture by default as Flight Simulator 2000 does not display colored roads correctly.
<LI>New: A new field in macro parameters, extra, that allows users to add more parameters if necessary.
