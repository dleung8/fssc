Title: Overview of the Program
Level: 2
Keywords: Overview

FS Scenery Creator is a powerful, easy-to-use, graphical scenery designer for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It features OpenGL drawing for a realistic bird's eye-view of your scenery, and an easy point-and-click interface. When ready for more fine-tuning, just open up a property page, and choose from a myriad of features and options.  FS Scenery Creator also supports macros in all standard formats (VOD, A&SD, FSSC, and Airport), which can greatly extend the boundaries of scenery design. FS Scenery Creator is an international-aware application featuring translations for property pages and help files to several languages of the world, and support for different standard units of measure.

The Help Desk is available for most of the year to try to answer all your questions about scenery design or about FS Scenery Creator. Live one-on-one help is available through the Internet's messenger services during some times of the day and year, and e-mail support is always available.

Level: 2
Keywords: FAQ

This section of the help file will expand as more questions are asked. If you have any questions, please send them to <A HREF="mailto:fsschelp@yahoo.com">fsschelp@yahoo.com</A> or through the Instant Messenger services. They may make it on this page!

<B>My aircraft bounces and jumps when taxiing on the scenery (FS2000, FS2002). How do I fix it?</B>
You must apply a different surface ground property for your area. In FS2000 this is only possible by setting an "invisible" runway, using the "Invisible" texture. Just make this runway as large and wide as the area you wish to have a smooth surface. In FS2002, you should use the Surface Area object with the Smooth attribute.

<B>Can I load airports in Flight Simulator into FS Scenery Creator?</B>
FS Scenery Creator does not yet support this feature. However, you can place objects accurately by using the latitude and longitude fields of any object.

<B>Can I add objects on top of an existing airport?</B>
Yes. This is by default, you do not have to do anything special.

<B>So how do I delete a default airport?</B>
Check the "Visual Scenery" box in the Exclusion tab of the Scenery Properties box.

<B>My plane is stuck on the ground and I can't move it. What's wrong? (Flight Simulator 2000 and above)</B>
You need to level your scenery area. Use the Flat Area object to set a uniform altitude, In FS2002, use a surface area with the "Smooth" attribute in addition to the Flat Area.

<B>I am seeing funny lines from my taxiways. How do I fix it?</B>
If you have any sections that overlap back on itself (near 180 degree angle), you need to turn off one of the sections. Select the point and change the Line Style attribute to Invisible. This is the expected behavior, as the same thing happens in Flight Simulator.

<B>Are my old FS Scenery Creator files compatible with the new version?</B>
FS Scenery Creator files from Version 1.1.x and 1.2.x can be loaded into Version 1.5. Any missing information is filled with default values. However, files created in later versions cannot be loaded into previous versions. Notes: Flatten areas generated in Version 1.1.x are not loaded. Lines that have both solid and lighted dot sections are not supported anymore and are loaded as solid lines. City and Fuel Area objects are now supported through Macros and are loaded as such.

<B>I am loading my Airport files into FS Scenery Creator. What should I expect to happen?</B>
The conversion process is not perfect. Dynamic Objects and adjustable macros currently cannot be loaded. If the file contains any macros that were bundled with Airport, Airport must be installed for the macros to load correctly. The rotation values of Runways and Menu Entries may be slightly incorrect due to the lack of precision of magnetic variation in earlier versions of Airport (2.1 and early 2.6 Builds).

<B>I am designing scenery for FS2000, CFS2, FS2002, or above, and have normal, night, winter, and spring bitmaps. How do I apply them in FS Scenery Creator?</B>
See the help entry on textures.

<B>The scenery generation is giving me "Inst_81: unknown command" errors. How do I solve this?</B>
SCASM 2.5/2.8 does not support this command anymore. Open the macro file in a text editor that has a replace function. Replace all instances of "Inst_81" to "Smoothing". 

<B>This section does not solve my problem(s). What should I do?</B>
See the Contact Information page on how to get in touch with me. 

<B>There are some features that I would like to be in FS Scenery Creator. What should I do?</B>
See the Contact Information page on how to get in touch with me. 

<B>I would like to contribute to the FS Scenery Creator project. How can I do so?</B>

FS Scenery Creator provides an intuitive point-and-click interface for creating and placing objects. However, if you need some help, this page will point out the steps to perform the basic tasks of scenery design.

To add an object:
Right-click on the editor where you want to add a new object. Select the desired object to add.

To select an object:
Left-click on the object's focus circle.

To select an obscured object:
Hold the Shift key, then left-click on the object's focus circle.

To select multiple objects:
Hold the Ctrl key while left-clicking on the desired objects. Left-click again on an object to unselect an object.

To select multiple objects within a rectangular region:
Click and hold down the left mouse button to drag a rectangular grid on the editor. Release the button when the desired objects fall within the rectangle.

To recenter the editor:
Double-click at the desired center point on the editor.

To move around the editor:
1) Use the scrollbars on the bottom and right edges of the screen, 2) use the mouse wheel to move vertically (hold down the Shift key to move horizontally), or 3) hold your mouse down at any edge of the screen as if you were dragging or gridding to scroll the screen in that direction at short intervals.

To rescale the editor:
1) Use the zoom buttons on the toolbar, 2) use the plus/minus (+/–) keys on your keyboard, 3) hold down Ctrl and use the mouse wheel, or 4) use the zoom to fit feature: click and drag a selection rectangle around the region of interest, and press the plus (+) key on the keyboard before releasing the mouse button.

To find out an object's name and position:
Hover the mouse cursor above the object's focus circle.

To move objects around graphically:
Left-click the mouse button and drag the object to the new location before releasing the mouse button. Drag multiple objects by selecting them, and then using the previous technique on any of the selected objects.

To edit an object's (or objects') properties:
Select the object, and then press F4, or right-click the object and select Properties. If multiple objects are under the mouse cursor, select the desired object from the list of choices.

To insert a point in a <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\road.html">road</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\river.html">river</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\line.html">line</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiwayline.html">taxiway line</A>, or <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat area</A>:
Click on any line of the object and drag the newly created point to the desired position.

Title: Units of Measure
Level: 3
Keywords: User Interface, User Interface\Units of Measure, Units of Measure

FS Scenery Creator version 1.5 features a powerful, but easy to use units interface for the scenery designer. Most text fields now have their unit of measure editable right in the field itself. When a property page is first displayed, each text field has its numeric value and the unit of measure shown in its abbreviation. The unit shown is usually the default length unit set in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences window</A>. When changing a field, you can also change the unit of measure if desired, and FS Scenery Creator will apply the necessary conversions when you press the OK button. If no unit is present, the default unit is assumed.

You can use the following suffixes to qualify the numeric value of a text field in the English version of FS Scenery Creator:.

Length:
m (meters), ft (feet), mi (miles), km (kilometers), nm (nautical miles)

Rotation:
°geo (geographic heading), °mag (magnetic heading)

File: reference\objects\runway.html
Title: Runway Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Runway

The runway is the basic scenery element of flight simulation and defines the airport. Most, if not all, sceneries that you will design will involve placing one or more runways.

There are several properties that are specific to each end of the runway. For scenery design purposes, the near end of the runway is defined to be the direction that is set in the Properties tab, and the far end is the reverse end of the runway. The instrument landing system (ILS) can also be set for each end of the runway.

To do a runway that is invisible but provides a landing surface (commonly called an invisible runway), select "Invisible" for the Runway Surface in the Textures tab. To not create a runway at all (for example, to create just an ILS), check the "Runway Visible" box in the "Runway" tab.

File: reference\objects\polygon.html
Title: Polygon Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Polygon

The polygon defines the texture of the ground. A polygon may be associated with a <A HREF="reference\properties\texture.html">texture</A> or a <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A>. The sides may optionally be dotted with lights. Polygons are primarily used to give the overall appearance of the ground, such as grass, dirt, concrete, or city streets. A polygon, however, does not define a landing area for an airplane. To do this, see the topic on <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat areas</A>, and on <A HREF="reference\objects\surfacearea.html">surface areas</A>.

Polygons are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\taxiway.html
Title: Taxiway Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Taxiway

The taxiway links a runway to the terminal. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a taxiway by a series of connected points. For advanced users, it may be somewhat beneficial for speed in using the discontinuity property (see <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">point object</A>) to design an entire airport's taxiway network with one taxiway object. Taxiways may optionally be lined with blue lights, and have a centerline. For greater control over the placement of taxiways, designers have used a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">polygon</A> with dotted blue lights to simulate a taxiway.

Taxiways are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\road.html
Title: Road Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Road

Roads in Flight Simulator are for decorative purposes only. Its usage in FS Scenery Creator is similar to a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a road by a series of connected points. Roads may optionally be filled with moving car lights at night.

Roads are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\river.html
Title: River Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\River

Using a river in FS Scenery Creator is virtually the same as using a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>. Please see that topic for details.

Rivers are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\line.html
Title: Line Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Line

At its most basic function, the line object draws a line in the Flight Simulator world. This can be used to define taxiway centerlines, or elevated power lines. However, the most powerful feature of the line is that you can link a <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> or a <A HREF="reference\objects\macro.html">macro</A> with a line, and have the linked object be repeated at regular intervals. To do this, simply select an object type, edit its properties and type in a spacing factor.

Lines are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\taxiwayline.html
Title: Taxiway Line Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Taxiway Line

The taxiway line object allows you to define FS2002 style taxiway markings. You can select from seven different styles of taxiway lines. If you want curved corners, set the arc radius field to greater than 0. To understand the arc radius parameter, imagine a circle with the specified radius. Align the circle so that it is tangent to both lines that form the corner. The smaller arc of the circle now approximately forms the curve of the resulting taxiway line.

Taxiway lines are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\building.html
Title: Building Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Building

The building can be used to make houses, office buildings, or airport terminals. Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, you can use the advanced building style to mix and match many different textures. An advanced building has 4 different levels: the lobby, the floors, the penthouse, and the roof, and each level can be customized in terms of height, texture, and texture stretching factor. You can preview the textures and the scaling that you've chosen using the building editor.

Besides the default four-sided flat roof style, you can also choose the pyramid, sloped, or n-sided styles.

The macro is able to extend FS Scenery Creator beyond its predefined objects. Macros are developed by hobbyists around the world, and usually come in one of several standard formats which can be read by FS Scenery Creator. A macro is usually a complex object with intricate textures and shapes; for example, a tree, a building, or an airplane. They may provide parameters that can be used to customize the object (such as the <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A> or the dimensions of the object). These can be set in the third tab of the Macro property page.

Because the use of "includes" is obsolete, FS Scenery Creator does not provide direct support for them. However, if you do have occasion to use one, simply use the macro object with the file name of the include. The include will simply ignore any parameters passed into it.

File: reference\objects\atis.html
Title: ATIS Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\ATIS

An ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information System) sends out information regarding flight conditions around an airport. The text is limited to 255 characters. Several escape sequences are available to shorten the message to within the allowable limit, or to insert actual weather conditions. These sequences are available by clicking the Insert button under the text field. This object is not available in FS2000 or above as it has been replaced with a voice version which is no longer part of the scenery design language.

File: reference\objects\vor.html
Title: VOR Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\VOR

A VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) is a beacon used in aircraft navigation. To learn more about VORs, consult the Flight Simulator handbook.

If the "List in Facility Database" box is checked, information about the VOR will be entered into the Airport and Facility Directory database which includes the GPS map view.

File: reference\objects\ndb.html
Title: NDB Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\NDB

An NDB (Non-Directional Radio Beacon) is a beacon used in aircraft navigation. To learn more about NDBs, consult the Flight Simulator handbook.

If the "List in Facility Database" box is checked, information about the NDB will be entered into the Airport and Facility Directory database which includes the GPS map view.

File: reference\objects\tower.html
Title: Tower Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Tower

A Tower defines the location of an airport control tower, and also the different frequencies associated with the airport. Since each scenery file is restricted to one airfield, there can only be one tower at a time on the editor.

File: reference\objects\menuentry.html
Title: Menu Entry Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Menu Entry

The menu entry object positions aircraft at specific points inside your scenery. The entries created by the Menu Entry object will appear in the "Scenery 6.0 and before" section of the Airport and Facility Directory in Flight Simulator.

Alternatively, you can also provide starting locations for your airport in the Airport and Facility Directory. In the Runway property page, check "Airport Facility Entry", and starting locations for both ends of the runways will be automatically created for you.

File: reference\objects\background.html
Title: Background Image Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Background Image

A background image allows you to overlay image files over the editor to get an accurate placement of objects, or when the visible property is checked, it allows you to place the image as-is in the Flight Simulator world.

To place the image accurately, you must either have the scale of the image in meters per pixel (or some other compatible distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">unit</A>) or the coordinates of two opposite corners and the rotation of the image.

<B>Note:</B> If you are placing a visible bitmap, FS Scenery Creator may generate a converted bitmap in the destination texture directory in a format compatible with Flight Simulator. If you are redistributing your scenery, be sure to include this file.

File: reference\objects\flatarea.html
Title: Flat Area Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Flat Area

A flat area defines a level surface for your airport, and is a must for any airfield that is not already defined in some way in the Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2 default world. For Flight Simulator 98, Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, use <A HREF="reference\scenery.html">Synthetic Scenery</A>. For Flight Simulator 2002, you use a Flat Area to set the desired altitude, and a <A HREF="reference\objects\surfacearea.html">Surface Area</A> in addition to the flat area if the scenery area was a body of water in the default scenery.

Choose from two different ways to flatten your scenery:.

<UL>
<LI><B>Flatten Switch (scenery.cfg):</B> These are several lines of instructions in the FS\scenery.cfg file that tell Flight Simulator to flatten a given area. This method is limited to 1 flat area per scenery area. Unless there is a good reason to do so, use the Area16N method instead.
<LI><B>Area16N:</B> This is the recommended method for Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2. A separate BGL file is generated with the flat area commands and there are no practical limitations on the number and the size of each flat area. Each flat area is surrounded by slopes to blend in with the surrounding altitudes.
</UL>

Flat Areas are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.

File: reference\objects\surfacearea.html
Title: Surface Area Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Surface Area

A surface area can either define a platform (such as those for helipads), or the ground type (runway, grass, water). For designing airports that do not exist in the Flight Simulator 2002 default world, you must use a Surface Area with "Smooth" type to have the area landable.

File: reference\objects\exclusion.html
Title: Exclusion Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Exclusion

The exclusion object is used to eliminate scenery elements of an underlying scenery. If there is an existing airfield in the default Flight Simulator world that you are trying to rebuild, use the exclusion object to delete those objects so that they don't show through on your scenery.

File: reference\objects\code.html
Title: SCASM Code Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\SCASM Code

The SCASM code object is used to write raw code in the Scenery Assembler language in FS Scenery Creator. This object is present to provide the import feature with a default object, and is rarely used in actual scenery design. The documentation for the SCASM language is given in the FSSC\Scasm subfolder.

File: reference\objects\point.html
Title: Point Object
Level: 4
Keywords: Objects, Objects\Point

The Point defines the shape of a parent object which includes the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\road.html">road</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\river.html">river</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\line.html">line</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiwayline.html">Taxiway Line</A>, and <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat area</A>.

Besides the <A HREF="reference\properties\position.html">position</A> properties, the point also has a type property. The following choices may not be present for certain types of objects:.

<UL>
<LI><B>Visible:</B> A line (or taxiway, etc.) is drawn to the next point.
<LI><B>Invisible:</B> A discontinuity exists between the point and the next point, i.e. no line is drawn.
<LI><B>Dotted:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals to the next point.
<LI><B>Taxiway:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals along this edge of the polygon.
</UL>

Points can be created by clicking on a line of the parent object that you want to create a point in, or by pressing the Insert key. Points are deleted using the Delete key, or by using the Delete option from the <A HREF="ui\menus\edit.html">Edit menu</A>. If the number of points fall below the allowable limit, the parent object is automatically deleted for you.

The maximum number of points that can be created are: 80 for Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, 2000 for Flight Simulator 2000 and above, and 30 for a Flat Area that uses a flatten switch.

The Z property can be used to create different effects, such as slanted polygons. However, this should only be changed by the most advanced users.

File: reference\properties\index.html
Title: Properties
Level: 3
Keywords: Properties

The following pages describe properties of some <A HREF="reference\objects\index.html">objects</A> in detail. To get help on other properties that are not in this section, simply click the <img src="images/help.gif"> button at the upper right hand corner of any window, and then clicking on the item of interest.

File: reference\properties\position.html
Title: Position Properties (X/Y, and Latitude/Longitude)
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Position, Position, X/Y, Latitude/Longitude

The position properties determine where the object is placed in the world. There are two ways to locate an object: either by describing the distance from a reference point (the X and Y properties) or by an absolute position (the latitude and longitude properties). Both sets of properties can be used in FS Scenery Creator.

The X and Y values can be entered in any distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">units</A> and are relative to the scenery center point.

The latitude and longitude values can be entered in decimal format (which is the more accurate of the two), or the fractional minutes format which is the default format used in Flight Simulator. You can, however, change this setting in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>, and the change will be reflected the next time you start Flight Simulator. Regardless of the current setting, FS Scenery Creator can detect and convert either format into X/Y values.

Graphically, you can change the positional properties by dragging an object around the editor. The current position of your mouse is displayed in the statusbar in both X/Y and Latitude/Longitude form.

File: reference\properties\rotation.html
Title: Rotation
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Rotation, Rotation, Heading

Rotation (called heading in previous versions of FS Scenery Creator) determines the orientation of an object. It is only available in some objects such as the building and the runway. Because the magnetic rotation value of the same physical direction may vary from year to year, FS Scenery Creator stores all rotations in the geographic measurement which is fixed. (However, you can set FS Scenery Creator to display rotations in magnetic form in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>). As discussed in the <A HREF="ui\units.html">units of measure</A> topic, you can enter rotations in either format.

<B>Note:</B> FS Scenery Creator uses the magnetic variation table of the currently selected Flight Simulator version to determine the geographic to magnetic conversions.

File: reference\properties\color.html
Title: Color
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Color, Color

While texturing has gained much more importance in the past few years as graphics engines have become much faster, colors are still an important part of the scenery. FS Scenery Creator provides a large palette of colors that can be accessed from the property pages of objects that support it. You may choose from the basic colors, or the night-illuminated colors supported in all versions of Flight Simulator, or if you are designing for Flight Simulator 2000 or higher, you can specify any red-green-blue color to generate one of more than 16 million colors. You can also choose from 16 levels of transparency (from clear to opaque) to control shading, and you can make any color (not just the night palette colors) night persistent.

File: reference\properties\texture.html
Title: Texture
Level: 4
Keywords: Properties, Properties\Texture, Texture

Textures fill and shade most of the Flight Simulator world. Most objects use some form of texturing to decorate the object. In FS Scenery Creator, you can choose from a set list of textures for some objects, such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> and <A HREF="reference\objects\runway.html">runway</A> objects, or from a list of textures on your file system such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A> object.

Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, different textures can be used for different times of the day, and for different seasons. These textures need to be named in a special naming convention so that they can be detected by Flight Simulator. The following list summarizes the naming convention:.

<UL>
<LI>Normal: base.bmp
<LI>Night: base_LM.bmp
<LI>Spring: base_SP.bmp
<LI>Fall: base_FA.bmp
<LI>Winter: base_WI.bmp
<LI>Hard winter: base_HW.bmp
</UL>

Unfortunately, most bitmaps cannot be used as-is by Flight Simulator, and must first be processed by a bitmap editing program such as BMP2000, DxtBMP, or Microsoft's ImageTool.

<H4>Version 1.2.0-1.2.5 (December 11, 2000 - February 9, 2001):</H4>
Note: Versions 1.2.0 through 1.2.4 were non-public beta releases. This list only contains the fixes for bugs in version 1.1.9, and the new features developed in version 1.2.0 or during the beta test period and not the bugs that were in the beta versions. Many thanks to the beta testers.

<UL>
<LI>Fixed: There was a slight miscalculation in all the older versions: though the default scale is 4 meters per pixel, and the zoom in/out doubles or halves the scale value, the scale value was something closer to 3.9, and thus the X/Y values were not whole numbers.
<LI>Fixed: Runway lights options were written incorrectly for Flight Simulator 2000 runways.
<LI>New: SCASM now included as the scenery compiler.
<LI>New: More macros bundled.
<LI>New: FS Scenery Creator is now in several more languages: French, Spanish, German, and Polish.
<LI>New: Ability to place objects using Latitude/Longitude.
<LI>New: Ability to orient objects using true or magnetic heading.
<LI>New: Choice of metric or standard measurements. Changes meters to feet or vice versa. However, since FS Scenery Creator stores measurements internally as metric, and some measurements are in integers, some values may be rounded slightly. (Example: 35 feet -> 11 meters -> 36 feet.)
<LI>New: Polygons can now be filled with the polygon color. Taxiways, Roads, Rivers, and lines can be drawn with thick lines (as wide as the width you specify). These features can be turned off in the Options dialog box.
<LI>New: Airport and Facilities Directory support. You have the option to put Airport, VOR, and NDB information in the FS98/FS2000 AFD format by selecting the check box in the respective objects, and by setting the scenery location in the Header properties box. AFD code is generated in a separate source file: filename_AFD.sca. The first ATIS of your scenery will be used as the frequency of the airport. You have the option to compile AFD data in the File menu.
<LI>New: A new object, the Flat area allows you to flatten scenery (for FS2000 only). You can choose to use flatten switches, or the Area16N command. However, only the first flat area using flatten switches is processed; all other flat areas using flatten switches are ignored. There is no limitation for Area16N's. Note: Flatten areas in older versions are not loaded into FSSC 1.2. They will be loaded as regular polygons. Area16N's are generated in a separate source file: filename_A16N.sca. FS Scenery Creator will automatically compile this file.
<LI>New: Ability to select up to three macro directories in the Options dialog box in addition to the default "FS Scenery Creator\Macros" directory. All API macros found in these directories will be listed in the macro object selection box. The file list is created the first time and then cached.
<LI>New: A better macro drawing algorithm. FS Scenery Creator now reads TexPolys and Poly commands. More macros should be drawn accurately in this version than in the last.
<LI>New: Ability to name objects. All objects can now be named (The Airport files import process is appropriately changed to reflect this new feature). If no name is specified, the default name will be used. This feature has no reflection on the compiled SCASM code, but some users may find it helpful for organizational purposes.
<LI>New: More options for FS2000 runways such as red-ended centerlines, and threshold zone lights, and ability to place the VASI/PAPI on both sides of the runway.
<LI>New: Runways can now be placed either with the specified position being the center of the runway, or the near end of the runway.
<LI>New: Ability to change the placement of the VASI/PAPI.
<LI>New: Updated import functionality for Airport files saved by builds 82/89.
<LI>New: Taxiway centerlines, and line objects can now be more than 1 meter wide. However, dotted lines that are more than 1 meter thick will be ignored, and treated as "Skip to" lines. Appropriately, now you can click on the entire thickness of the line to create new points.
<LI>New: Objects list now integrated into the editor. Selecting "Objects" from the Scenery menu will open up a second pane in the main screen. All changes made in one pane will be reflected in the other. You can resize and dock the panel either on the right or left side.
<LI>New: Multiple background images. The background image is now an object. This change allows you to drag your bitmap to any position like any other object. Backgrounds will always be drawn below any other object in the editor, but you can still use the Bring To Front, Send To Back commands to control which image overlaps which ones.
<LI>New: Optional prompt to save before compilation.
<LI>New: Autosave file feature enables FS Scenery Creator to save your file to a temporary location (C:\Windows\Temp) every several minutes. If FS Scenery Creator terminates normally, these files are deleted.
<LI>New: Ability to specify a zoom level manually between 0.01 and 64 meters. (Note, there is a problem with drawing polygon lines at very small scales which is inherent in how Windows draws them. The polygon fill feature is also disabled for 0.0625 meters per pixel and smaller because of this same problem.
<LI>New: Ability to measure the distance between two points on the editor. Simply click and hold the mouse button at the first point, and drag to the second point. The statusbar will show you the distance of the diagonal of the gridding box. Hit the Esc key to abort the multi-select.
<LI>New: Objects can now be locked into place, locked objects cannot be dragged in the editor.
<LI>New: Polygons, Taxiways, Roads, Rivers, and Lines can now optionally be locked so that additional points cannot be created.
<LI>New: Default button in the Options dialog box allows you to revert to the standard settings.
<LI>New: The Bring to Front/Send to Back command now works with points. Selecting either of these commands will bring to front/send to back the entire shape. This should lessen the need to use layers, which slow down Flight Simulator's graphics engine.
<LI>New: Ability to transform (shift and rotate) selected objects (or the entire scenery).
<LI>New: The delete command now selects the next object after operation, so you can press Del multiple times. Note: because of the way objects are stored by FSSC, the next object may not be the next point of the polygon.
<LI>New: Support for mouse wheel. To scroll up or down the editor, roll your mouse wheel up or down. To scroll sideways, hold the shift key: mouse wheel up scrolls to the left and mouse wheel down scrolls to the right.

Title: Getting Acquainted: Lesson 1

<H5>Getting acquainted</H5>

If FS Scenery Creator is not open, start the program: Click on your Start Menu, highlight the Programs folder, find Leung Software, and click on FS Scenery Creator.

Welcome to FS Scenery Creator! After the program has loaded, you will see the main editor window. Below the title bar, you will find the menus you use to access various features. And below the menu bar is the toolbar which provides shortcuts for frequently used features.

On the bottom of the window, you will find the statusbar. When the mouse is over the editor, the statusbar contains the current position of the mouse in world coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the relative position from the reference point (horizontal and vertical distance). It will also show the name of the object that the mouse is currently hovering over.

Title: Getting Acquainted: Lesson 2

<H5>Objects</H5>

Between the toolbar and the status bar is the editor. When you start a new scenery, the editor consists of gridlines spaced 1 kilometer apart horizontally and vertically. If you right-click on the editor, you will be presented with the Editor menu which allows you to add objects. (Alternatively, you can press the Menu key, or Shift+F10)

Like many computer-aided design applications, FS Scenery Creator uses the object system. Each scenery element (such as a building or a runway) is an object, and all objects have at least the X and Y property which tells the program where to draw the object. Each object also has a circle around its selection area where you can left-click to select the object. When selected, this circle and the object outline (if it exists) is bright blue.

When you click another object, the previous object loses focus. If you want to select multiple objects, hold the Ctrl key down when clicking. Alternatively, if you click where there are no objects and drag a rectangle, the objects within the rectangle are selected for you.

File: tutorials\tuta3.html
Title: Getting Acquainted: Lesson 3

<H5>Properties</H5>

Once an object is selected, you can edit its properties. A right-click will bring up the menu (as a shortcut, you can right click on an object to select it and bring up the Editor menu at the same time), and below the Add Objects options, you will find a list of objects that are selected. Selecting one of these will bring up its property page. When multiple objects are selected, there will also be a "Properties" option where you can collectively edit the properties of all the items. Depending on the type of objects selected, you may be presented with a specialized property page, or a generic page where you can only edit the position properties.

If you want to change the position of selected objects, just click on any of the selected object and drag them to the new location. All of the other selected objects will move the same distance. A new feature of FS Scenery Creator is that if you drag objects near the edge of the screen, the program will automatically scroll the editor at small intervals. (This will also happen when you are making a selection rectangle.)

You can use the following shortcut keys. Pressing F4 will open up the selected object's property page with the first tab selected. F5 will open up the page with the second tab selected, and F6, F7, and F8 will open up the page with the third, fourth, and fifth tab selected respectively. If multiple objects are selected, the multiple objects property page will be shown.

Title: Getting Acquainted: Lesson 4

<H5>Moving around</H5>

You can move around the editor in several ways. To recenter the editor, double click at the new center point. To move at small intervals, you can use the scrollbars at the right and bottom of the editor, or use the mouse wheel (roll normally to move vertically, or hold the shift button to move horizontally). If you have the left mouse button down (for gridding or dragging), the editor will scroll if the mouse is at one of the edges.

FS Scenery Creator can draw your screen at different zoom levels. Simply click the plus or minus buttons at the top of the screen to zoom in and out. Alternatively use the plus (+) or minus (-) key on the keyboard, or hold Ctrl on your keyboard while rolling the mouse wheel. You can also zoom in at a specific region by dragging a selection rectangle around the area of interest, and then pressing the plus (+) key before releasing the mouse button (this is called Zoom to Fit).

Title: The Basics: Lesson 1

<H5>Some Notes:</H5>

Different versions of Flight Simulator have slightly different requirements in terms of scenery design. Please pay attention to these differences in the tutorial with the corresponding versions of Flight Simulator that they apply to (FS95, FS98, CFS1, FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2).

Be sure to read through the <A HREF="tutorials\tuta1.html">Getting Acquainted</A> tutorial first.

<B>Do not be fooled by the title of this tutorial.</B> The title refers not to the difficulty of this tutorial, but to the steps required to make a minimal scenery in Flight Simulator. Good luck.

This tutorial assumes that you are using the default color scheme of FS Scenery Creator. You might also want to check that you have the correct version of Flight Simulator checked in the Preferences dialog box, as some features are disabled depending on the version selected as it is not supported.

<H5>Start up:</H5>

If FS Scenery Creator is not open, start the program: Click on your Start Menu, highlight the Programs folder, find Leung Software, and click on FS Scenery Creator.

Title: The Basics: Lesson 2

<H5>Location, Location, Location</H5>

First, we have to set the location of the scenery. Go to the Edit menu, and then click Scenery Properties. For starters, type in your name in the "Credits" tab. Go to the "Dimensions" tab to set the current location of the scenery. We will keep with the default latitude and longitude for now (N0, E0).

Notice that most of the text boxes have a number followed by a unit of measure (such as m or ft). You can set the program to display these numbers either in the metric system or the standard (English) system in the Preferences dialog box. However, regardless of your setting, you can append any recognized unit to a number. For example, if your setting is metric, all of the following are equivalent, and are recognized by the program: 1000m, 3280ft, 1km, 0.54nm, 0.621mi. 1000 is also recognized as meters is the default length unit in the metric setting. If your system is configured to use the comma as the decimal delimiter, please use a comma, as the program will not recognize the period.

For our little island in the sea, set the altitude to 10m (32.8ft).

<H5>The Airport and Facilities Directory</H5>

<WARN>FS95 does not support this feature.</WARN>

In the "Airport" tab, we can set the political attributes of the scenery, the man-made designations that will help us locate our airport in the Airport and Facilities Directory in Flight Simulator. Feel free to change the Name, Region, Country, State, City, and ICAO ID properties. All fields are required except for State for the directory entry to appear properly. <WARN>FS2002: The Language Code should remain US English regardless of your version of Flight Simulator.</WARN>

<H5>Synthetic Scenery</H5>

<WARN>FS95, FS98, and CFS1 only</WARN>

In the Synthetic Scenery tab, we can choose a size and picture (texture) of the ground around the vicinity of the airport. Setting the size to something other than "None" is required only if you want to change the altitude to something that is different from the default scenery, or to change the ground from water to land. Since we are doing both with our island, go ahead and set the size to the third option (14700m, 48100ft), and to any texture other than Transparent. Synthetic tiles are arranged as blocks of varying (but limited) sizes in a fixed grid. FS Scenery Creator displays the possible block sizes, and makes the closest fit of blocks to the given scenery center. The block boundary will be marked by a thick black rectangle on the editor. You may need to zoom out a few times to see the boundary.

<H5>Wrap up</H5>
Press OK and continue to the next page.

File: tutorials\tutb3.html
Title: The Basics: Lesson 3

<H5>Necessities</H5>

Of course, an airport needs a runway. Create one by right clicking on the editor, selecting "New 2D object", and "Runway". You are now presented with the Runway property page. This is the most complex page in the entire program, but we will look at only a few of the options for now.

<H5>Position</H5>

In the "Runway" tab, we see the X/Y and Latitude/Longitude. These properties specify the position of the runway (it is currently set to where you clicked on the editor) and the two pairs are linked together: changing one pair changes the other. This is because there are two ways of specifying position: distance from the scenery center (X/Y) or world coordinates. There are instances where it is easier to specify one pair over the other. For now, leave them the way they are.

<H5>Rotation</H5>

Rotation specifies the direction of the runway. Let's set it to "25°geo" for now. This means that the runway will be facing 25 degrees clockwise from true north. We can also specify "34°mag" which would be approximately the same heading. If you are not familiar with the difference between the geographic north pole, and magnetic north pole, the axis that the earth spins on intersects the geographic north pole, and magnetic compasses point towards the magnetic north pole. The geographic north pole is constant, whereas the magnetic north pole fluctuates slightly over time. Because the compass is used as a primary navigating instrument on an aircraft, the magnetic heading is used when flying, whereas the stability of the geographic heading is more valuable in scenery design.

You can set which convention the program uses, either Geographic, or Magnetic. Internally, the program stores all rotation fields as geographical; this may affect you if you later move the airfield to a different location on the globe. As the geographic to magnetic conversion varies from location to location, the magnetic heading of the same runway will change. If you do not specify a unit, the convention specified in the Preferences dialog box is used. In any case, the degree symbol "°" is optional and can be omitted (i.e. "25geo").

<H5>Runway ID</H5>
The Runway ID is the designation that is painted on the runway threshold, and is what pilots and controllers use to refer to a runway. By convention, it is usually named by taking the magnetic rotation of the runway, dividing by ten and rounding to the nearest integer. If two runways have the same rotation, the left one has an "L" suffix, and the right one has an "R" suffix. For three runways, the center one has a "C" suffix. The reverse ID is automatically determined for you. Our runway at 34°mag would have an ID of "3".

<H5>Markings and Lights</H5>
This tab changes the appearance of the markings on the runway and the basic runway lights. The best way to learn about the markings is to actually see them in Flight Simulator. You can see them with the "Runway Gallery" sample files in the Samples folder. To view these files, open the one appropriate for your version of Flight Simulator and then Export them, following the scenery installation instructions later in this tutorial.

<H5>Textures</H5>
This tab controls the type of surface for the runway. For now, keep the overrun surfaces automatic, and choose any runway surface.

Title: The Basics: Lesson 4

<H5>Creating the ground</H5>

We are now ready to create the ground. To do this, create a polygon by right clicking on the editor, selecting "New 2D object", and "Polygon". We are mainly concerned with the "Texture" setting right now. Click in the text field to bring up the selection dialog box. Find "grass.r8" and press OK. Press OK in the original property page to create the polygon.

<H5>Sizing it</H5>
A polygon is slightly different than a runway  on the editor in that you select it by the corners (or points) of the polygon. Initially, a polygon is created with 3 points in a triangle. Drag each point around the editor so that it covers the entire area around the runway. When you need to create a new point, click and drag on any line segment on the polygon to create a new corner. In this way, you can size and shape the polygon to whatever you want. If you inadvertently make a point, select it, and press the Del key on your keyboard to erase it.

<H5>Raising the runway</H5>
You might have noticed that the runway has now been obscured by the polygon. To move the polygon under the runway, select any point of the polygon, right click, select "Order" and "Send to back". Now your runway is visible again.

Title: The Basics: Lesson 5

<H5>Landfill</H5>

<WARN>FS2000, CFS2, FS2002 and above only</WARN>

While we already set the altitude of the scenery previously, we still need tell Flight Simulator the boundaries and altitude of the area within the boundary. This is necessary as the later versions of Flight Simulator can have variable altitudes within one area. To do so, create a new flat area (right click on the editor, New Misc. Object, Flat Area). If the Flat Area option is grayed, be sure that the correct version of Flight Simulator is selected in the Preferences dialog box. Set the altitude to the same number as before (10m, 32.8ft) and press OK.

Now, drag and create new points of the Flat Area so that it encompasses the entire runway and polygon. This will mark the boundary of the plateau. Beyond this area, the land will slope gently to the original altitude (0 in this case).

<WARN>FS2000 only</WARN>

Since the island we created was originally an ocean, we need to tell Flight Simulator that it is now a piece of land. In FS2000, it is only possible to change the taxiing surface condition of the terrain by setting an invisible "dummy" runway. Right click at the editor and select "New 2D Object" and "Runway". Uncheck the "Runway visible" checkbox entry, set the width to 2000m (6560ft), and the length to 4000m (13120ft). Deactivate the "Airport and Facilities Entry" as well. As runway surface, select concrete. Click "OK" to create the invisible runway. Without this invisible runway, our aircraft will "stick to the ground" and won´t move as soon as entering the grass polygon. This is because the FS2000 terrain surface condition of "ocean waves" is still valid, although a grass polygon was designed. Unfortunately, only a runway can overwrite that terrain surface property in FS2000.

<H5>Leveling</H5>

<WARN>FS2002 and above only</WARN>

Since the island we created was originally an ocean, we need to tell Flight Simulator that it is now a piece of land. To do this, right click at the center of the Runway and select "New Misc. Object" and "Surface Area". Verify that the "Type" is set to "Smooth", set Horizontal to 2000m (6560ft) and Vertical to 4000m (13120ft) and press OK. Make sure the box encompasses the entire Runway area.

Title: The Basics: Lesson 6

<H5>Save and Export</H5>

It is now a good time to save the scenery. Select "Save As" from the File menu to save the file. Select the location and name of the file to save it. This puts the scenery onto disk, so that you can come back to it later. However, the file is saved in FS Scenery Creator's format and it's not ready for Flight Simulator yet. To do this, select "Export Scenery Wizard" from the File menu. The default choices are to create a new file folder structure under the FS\Scenery directory. We will accept that and press "OK".

<WARN>FS98, CFS1</WARN>
You now need to tell Flight Simulator that you have a new scenery. Start Flight Simulator if you have not already. Select "Scenery Library" from the World menu. Press OK if a reminder about using the Scenery Library pops up. Make sure "FS World" is now selected and then click the "Files" button. Click "Add". For the scenery area path, type in "=:\=\scenery\SceneryName\SCENERY\*.BGL" (without the quotes). Substitute the file name that you gave your scenery for "SceneryName". The rest of the dialog box should now light up. Enter in your airport name for the "Scenery Area Title". The "Scenery Area Type" should be Local, and the area should be active. Press OK for all of the dialog boxes, and your scenery should now load.

<WARN>FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2</WARN>
Your scenery should be installed automatically. If the scenery appears different, or elements are missing, the first thing you should do is to close and restart Flight Simulator.

<H5>Viewing the scenery</H5>
From the World menu, select "Go to Airport". Find your airport by typing or browsing for the name of your airport that you gave earlier (in the Scenery Properties page). Press OK to move to your Airport. Voila!

Title: The Objects: Lesson 1

<H5>Some Notes:</H5>

Different versions of Flight Simulator have slightly different requirements in terms of scenery design. Please pay attention to these differences in the tutorial with the corresponding versions of Flight Simulator that they apply to (FS95, FS98, CFS1, FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2).

Be sure to read through the <A HREF="tutorials\tuta1.html">Getting Acquainted</A> and <A HREF="tutorials\tutb1.html">The Basics</A> tutorial first.

This tutorial assumes that you are using the default color scheme of FS Scenery Creator. You might also want to check that you have the correct version of Flight Simulator checked in the Preferences dialog box, as some features are disabled depending on the version selected as it is not supported.

<H5>Start up:</H5>

If FS Scenery Creator is not open, start the program: Click on your Start Menu, highlight the Programs folder, find Leung Software, and click on FS Scenery Creator.

Title: The Objects: Lesson 2

<H5>The 2D Objects</H5>

You have already seen the Runway and the Polygon in action in the last tutorial. We will now go over the rest of the 2D objects, taxiways, roads, rivers, lines, and taxiway lines.

<H5>Taxiway, Roads and Rivers</H5>
These three objects work almost exactly the same way. Create a taxiway by right clicking on the editor, selecting 2D objects, and then Taxiway. We will also enable centerline dots for the taxiway. Check the Dots box. Now, you can change the distance between dots and the dot color. Click OK to create the taxiway. Now, just like polygons, you can drag and create new points as needed. For our example, say we are creating a taxiway that is parallel to the runway, and we are creating turn-off paths. At a section of the taxiway, click on it to create a new point. Now, click on a section of the line and drag another point so that it touches the runway. Now, create yet another point and bring the taxiway back to the first point. (If you bring the mouse close enough to a line or a point, FS Scenery Creator will automatically bring the two points together. The Snapping feature can be disabled in the Preferences dialog box).

Depending on how you placed the taxiway and the points, you may be seeing random lines emanating the point where the two sections converged. This is expected behavior, and the same effect will appear in Flight Simulator. The problem is the 180 degree turn that we introduced confused the graphics engine, and in addition one of the sections of the taxiway is not really necessary, and one should be turned off. To do this, select the point touching the Runway, open up the properties page (press F4), and then select "Invisible" for the Line Style.

After you are done, you can compare your results to the Objects Tutorial sample file in the Samples folder.

Roads and Rivers work the same way. <WARN>FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2, and above:</WARN> Roads have an additional "Type" attribute. You can choose from differents types of roads and railroads from this list.

<H5>Lines</H5>
The Line object can be used in different ways: to draw a line, to draw a series of lighted dots, or to draw a series of 3D objects. To draw a single line, set the width to (0.1m, 0.328ft). You will not be able to select a texture if you use this option. To draw a thick line, set the desired width, and then select a texture or a color. To draw a series of dots, check the "Dots" box, and to draw a series of 3D objects, select the type of object in the Object dropdown box, and click Edit to change the attributes of the object. These attributes will be described in the next page of this tutorial.

<H5><WARN>FS2002 and above only:</WARN> Taxiway Line</H5>
These taxiway lines are the same as the ones you see in the default scenery in Flight Simulator 2002. First, select the type of line. The arc radius attribute controls the curvature of corners. Imagine a ball of the specified radius dropped into the angle formed by the bend between two lines. The smaller arc of the circle is the arc that is drawn in Flight Simulator.

Title: The Objects: Lesson 3

<H5>The 3D Objects</H5>

There are two types of 3D objects: the Building and the Macro. (Macros do not necessarily have to be 3D objects, but they almost always are).

<H5>Building:</H5>
The building object is a quick way of placing a 3D structure in the scenery. Create a building by right-clicking on the editor, select 3D objects, and Building. Enter the desired width and length of the building, and then select the desired type of building.

Say that you have designed a scenery with a lot of buildings. You might want to allow users to disable some of the buildings so that they have better framerates. The standard way to do this is through Scenery Complexity: this is an option that can be set in Flight Simulator. In FS Scenery Creator, if you set an object to have a complexity of "Dense", this means that the building will be shown only if the user's Scenery Complexity is "Dense" or higher.

Now, click on the Levels tab. Depending on your building type selection, you may be able to change the attributes of different sections of the building; this is controlled by the "Level" dropdown box. You can change the texture of each level, and the number of times the texture is repeated in each direction. A preview is available to show you the results of setting different repeat rates.

Press OK to create the building.

<H5>Macros:</H5>
The Macro is the most powerful object in the program. With the macro, you have the ability to place objects that are not provided to you by the FS Scenery Creator program. When you create a macro, the first thing to do is to select the type of macro. You can click through the tree of macros, or browse for a file on your hard disk. Many macros of different objects are available on the Internet. Visit the FS Scenery Creator website for some webpage links. Once you have downloaded macros, you can set the "Macro Folder" locations in the Preferences box so that the macros are automatically added to your Macro list.

Macros are sometimes customizable. For example, select Macros\Structure\Observatory, and then click on the Parameters tab. There will be two customizable options: the colors of the two sections. For any parameter that requires a color, click on the text field, and the click on the "Color" tab. You can select textures similarly.

Press OK to create the macro.

Title: The Objects: Lesson 4

<H5><WARN>FS95, FS98, and CFS1:</WARN> ATIS</H5>
The ATIS object creates an ATIS transmitter (Automatic Terminal Information System). This is a beacon that broadcasts a message repeatedly. The "Text" attribute controls what is transmitted. Besides static text, you can also insert shortcuts by clicking on the "Insert" button. This allows you to enter dynamic information such as weather conditions or the current time.

<H5>VOR, NDB</H5>
These objects allow you to place a VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) or NDB (Non-Directional Radio Beacon) in your scenery. By checking the "List in Facility Database" box, the beacon will also appear in the Facility listing in Flight Simulator.

<H5><WARN>FS2K, CFS2, and above:</WARN> Tower</H5>
The Tower object allows you to specify the frequencies for your airport and the location of the control tower. The tower object does not actually place a control tower. There is a Control Tower macro for that purpose.

Title: The Objects: Lesson 5

<H5>Menu Entry</H5>
To define an arbitrary starting location, use the Menu Entry object. These entries will appear in the "Scenery from 6.0 and Before" in FS98 and CFS1, "Scenery from FS95 and before" in FS2K, and CFS2, and in "Add-on Scenery" in FS2K2. To create starting locations for runways that appear in the master list, check the "Airport Facility Entry" box for each runway.

<H5>Background Image</H5>
If you have a satelite photo of the airport that you are designing, you can insert it into the editor here. You will need to know either the location of the corners of the photo or the scale (m or ft per pixel) to accurately place the picture.

<H5>Exclusion</H5>
If you are designing over an existing airport, you can use the Exclusion object to cover the existing scenery. This feature is also available for the entire scenery in the Scenery Properties box.
