<H3>Units of Measure</H3>

<P>FS Scenery Creator version 1.5 features a powerful, but easy to use units interface for the scenery designer. Most text fields now have their unit of measure editable right in the field itself. When a property page is first displayed, each text field has its numeric value and the unit of measure shown in its abbreviation. The unit shown is usually the default length unit set in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences window</A>. When changing a field, you can also change the unit of measure if desired, and FS Scenery Creator will apply the necessary conversions when you press the OK button. If no unit is present, the default unit is assumed.</P>

<P>You can use the following suffixes to qualify the numeric value of a text field in the English version of FS Scenery Creator:</P>
