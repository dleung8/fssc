<P>Between the toolbar and the status bar is the editor. When you start a new scenery, the editor consists of gridlines spaced 1 kilometer apart horizontally and vertically. If you right-click on the editor, you will be presented with the Editor menu which allows you to add objects. (Alternatively, you can press the Menu key, or Shift+F10)</P>

<P>Like many computer-aided design applications, FS Scenery Creator uses the object system. Each scenery element (such as a building or a runway) is an object, and all objects have at least the X and Y property which tells the program where to draw the object. Each object also has a circle around its selection area where you can left-click to select the object. When selected, this circle and the object outline (if it exists) is bright blue.</P>

<P>When you click another object, the previous object loses focus. If you want to select multiple objects, hold the Ctrl key down when clicking. Alternatively, if you click where there are no objects and drag a rectangle, the objects within the rectangle are selected for you.</P>
