<P><H5>Moving around</H5></P>

<P>You can move around the editor in several ways. To recenter the editor, double click at the new center point. To move at small intervals, you can use the scrollbars at the right and bottom of the editor, or use the mouse wheel (roll normally to move vertically, or hold the shift button to move horizontally). If you have the left mouse button down (for gridding or dragging), the editor will scroll if the mouse is at one of the edges.</P>

<P>FS Scenery Creator can draw your screen at different zoom levels. Simply click the plus or minus buttons at the top of the screen to zoom in and out. Alternatively use the plus (+) or minus (-) key on the keyboard, or hold Ctrl on your keyboard while rolling the mouse wheel. You can also zoom in at a specific region by dragging a selection rectangle around the area of interest, and then pressing the plus (+) key before releasing the mouse button (this is called Zoom to Fit).</P>
