<H3>The Objects: Lesson 4</H3>

<P><H5><B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS95, FS98, and CFS1:</FONT></B> ATIS</H5></P>

<P>The ATIS object creates an ATIS transmitter (Automatic Terminal Information System). This is a beacon that broadcasts a message repeatedly. The "Text" attribute controls what is transmitted. Besides static text, you can also insert shortcuts by clicking on the "Insert" button. This allows you to enter dynamic information such as weather conditions or the current time.</P>

<P><H5>VOR, NDB</H5></P>

<P>These objects allow you to place a VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) or NDB (Non-Directional Radio Beacon) in your scenery. By checking the "List in Facility Database" box, the beacon will also appear in the Facility listing in Flight Simulator.</P>

<P><H5><B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS2K, CFS2, and above:</FONT></B> Tower</H5></P>

<P>The Tower object allows you to specify the frequencies for your airport and the location of the control tower. The tower object does not actually place a control tower. There is a Control Tower macro for that purpose.</P>
