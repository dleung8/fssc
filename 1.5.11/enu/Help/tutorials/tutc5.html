<H3>The Objects: Lesson 5</H3>

<P><H5>Menu Entry</H5></P>

<P>To define an arbitrary starting location, use the Menu Entry object. These entries will appear in the "Scenery from 6.0 and Before" in FS98 and CFS1, "Scenery from FS95 and before" in FS2K, and CFS2, and in "Add-on Scenery" in FS2K2. To create starting locations for runways that appear in the master list, check the "Airport Facility Entry" box for each runway.</P>

<P><H5>Background Image</H5></P>

<P>If you have a satelite photo of the airport that you are designing, you can insert it into the editor here. You will need to know either the location of the corners of the photo or the scale (m or ft per pixel) to accurately place the picture.</P>

<P><H5>Exclusion</H5></P>

<P>If you are designing over an existing airport, you can use the Exclusion object to cover the existing scenery. This feature is also available for the entire scenery in the Scenery Properties box.</P>
