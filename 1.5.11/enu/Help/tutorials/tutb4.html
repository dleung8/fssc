<P><H5>Creating the ground</H5></P>

<P>We are now ready to create the ground. To do this, create a polygon by right clicking on the editor, selecting "New 2D object", and "Polygon". We are mainly concerned with the "Texture" setting right now. Click in the text field to bring up the selection dialog box. Find "grass.r8" and press OK. Press OK in the original property page to create the polygon.</P>

<P><H5>Sizing it</H5></P>

<P>A polygon is slightly different than a runway  on the editor in that you select it by the corners (or points) of the polygon. Initially, a polygon is created with 3 points in a triangle. Drag each point around the editor so that it covers the entire area around the runway. When you need to create a new point, click and drag on any line segment on the polygon to create a new corner. In this way, you can size and shape the polygon to whatever you want. If you inadvertently make a point, select it, and press the Del key on your keyboard to erase it.</P>

<P><H5>Raising the runway</H5></P>

<P>You might have noticed that the runway has now been obscured by the polygon. To move the polygon under the runway, select any point of the polygon, right click, select "Order" and "Send to back". Now your runway is visible again.</P>
