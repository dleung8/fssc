<P>While we already set the altitude of the scenery previously, we still need tell Flight Simulator the boundaries and altitude of the area within the boundary. This is necessary as the later versions of Flight Simulator can have variable altitudes within one area. To do so, create a new flat area (right click on the editor, New Misc. Object, Flat Area). If the Flat Area option is grayed, be sure that the correct version of Flight Simulator is selected in the Preferences dialog box. Set the altitude to the same number as before (10m, 32.8ft) and press OK.</P>

<P>Now, drag and create new points of the Flat Area so that it encompasses the entire runway and polygon. This will mark the boundary of the plateau. Beyond this area, the land will slope gently to the original altitude (0 in this case).</P>

<P>Since the island we created was originally an ocean, we need to tell Flight Simulator that it is now a piece of land. In FS2000, it is only possible to change the taxiing surface condition of the terrain by setting an invisible "dummy" runway. Right click at the editor and select "New 2D Object" and "Runway". Uncheck the "Runway visible" checkbox entry, set the width to 2000m (6560ft), and the length to 4000m (13120ft). Deactivate the "Airport and Facilities Entry" as well. As runway surface, select concrete. Click "OK" to create the invisible runway. Without this invisible runway, our aircraft will "stick to the ground" and won´t move as soon as entering the grass polygon. This is because the FS2000 terrain surface condition of "ocean waves" is still valid, although a grass polygon was designed. Unfortunately, only a runway can overwrite that terrain surface property in FS2000.</P>

<P>Since the island we created was originally an ocean, we need to tell Flight Simulator that it is now a piece of land. To do this, right click at the center of the Runway and select "New Misc. Object" and "Surface Area". Verify that the "Type" is set to "Smooth", set Horizontal to 2000m (6560ft) and Vertical to 4000m (13120ft) and press OK. Make sure the box encompasses the entire Runway area.</P>
