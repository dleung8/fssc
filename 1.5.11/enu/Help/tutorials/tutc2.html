<H3>The Objects: Lesson 2</H3>

<P><H5>The 2D Objects</H5></P>

<P>You have already seen the Runway and the Polygon in action in the last tutorial. We will now go over the rest of the 2D objects, taxiways, roads, rivers, lines, and taxiway lines.</P>

<P><H5>Taxiway, Roads and Rivers</H5></P>

<P>These three objects work almost exactly the same way. Create a taxiway by right clicking on the editor, selecting 2D objects, and then Taxiway. We will also enable centerline dots for the taxiway. Check the Dots box. Now, you can change the distance between dots and the dot color. Click OK to create the taxiway. Now, just like polygons, you can drag and create new points as needed. For our example, say we are creating a taxiway that is parallel to the runway, and we are creating turn-off paths. At a section of the taxiway, click on it to create a new point. Now, click on a section of the line and drag another point so that it touches the runway. Now, create yet another point and bring the taxiway back to the first point. (If you bring the mouse close enough to a line or a point, FS Scenery Creator will automatically bring the two points together. The Snapping feature can be disabled in the Preferences dialog box).</P>

<P>Depending on how you placed the taxiway and the points, you may be seeing random lines emanating the point where the two sections converged. This is expected behavior, and the same effect will appear in Flight Simulator. The problem is the 180 degree turn that we introduced confused the graphics engine, and in addition one of the sections of the taxiway is not really necessary, and one should be turned off. To do this, select the point touching the Runway, open up the properties page (press F4), and then select "Invisible" for the Line Style.</P>

<P>After you are done, you can compare your results to the Objects Tutorial sample file in the Samples folder.</P>

<P>Roads and Rivers work the same way. <B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2, and above:</FONT></B> Roads have an additional "Type" attribute. You can choose from differents types of roads and railroads from this list.</P>

<P><H5>Lines</H5></P>

<P>The Line object can be used in different ways: to draw a line, to draw a series of lighted dots, or to draw a series of 3D objects. To draw a single line, set the width to (0.1m, 0.328ft). You will not be able to select a texture if you use this option. To draw a thick line, set the desired width, and then select a texture or a color. To draw a series of dots, check the "Dots" box, and to draw a series of 3D objects, select the type of object in the Object dropdown box, and click Edit to change the attributes of the object. These attributes will be described in the next page of this tutorial.</P>

<P><H5><B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS2002 and above only:</FONT></B> Taxiway Line</H5></P>

<P>These taxiway lines are the same as the ones you see in the default scenery in Flight Simulator 2002. First, select the type of line. The arc radius attribute controls the curvature of corners. Imagine a ball of the specified radius dropped into the angle formed by the bend between two lines. The smaller arc of the circle is the arc that is drawn in Flight Simulator.</P>
