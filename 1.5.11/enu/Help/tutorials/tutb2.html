<H3>The Basics: Lesson 2</H3>

<P><H5>Location, Location, Location</H5></P>

<P>First, we have to set the location of the scenery. Go to the Edit menu, and then click Scenery Properties. For starters, type in your name in the "Credits" tab. Go to the "Dimensions" tab to set the current location of the scenery. We will keep with the default latitude and longitude for now (N0, E0).</P>

<P>Notice that most of the text boxes have a number followed by a unit of measure (such as m or ft). You can set the program to display these numbers either in the metric system or the standard (English) system in the Preferences dialog box. However, regardless of your setting, you can append any recognized unit to a number. For example, if your setting is metric, all of the following are equivalent, and are recognized by the program: 1000m, 3280ft, 1km, 0.54nm, 0.621mi. 1000 is also recognized as meters is the default length unit in the metric setting. If your system is configured to use the comma as the decimal delimiter, please use a comma, as the program will not recognize the period.</P>

<P>For our little island in the sea, set the altitude to 10m (32.8ft).</P>

<P><H5>The Airport and Facilities Directory</H5></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS95 does not support this feature.</FONT></B></P>

<P>In the "Airport" tab, we can set the political attributes of the scenery, the man-made designations that will help us locate our airport in the Airport and Facilities Directory in Flight Simulator. Feel free to change the Name, Region, Country, State, City, and ICAO ID properties. All fields are required except for State for the directory entry to appear properly. <B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS2002: The Language Code should remain US English regardless of your version of Flight Simulator.</FONT></B></P>

<P><H5>Synthetic Scenery</H5></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="RED">FS95, FS98, and CFS1 only</FONT></B></P>

<P>In the Synthetic Scenery tab, we can choose a size and picture (texture) of the ground around the vicinity of the airport. Setting the size to something other than "None" is required only if you want to change the altitude to something that is different from the default scenery, or to change the ground from water to land. Since we are doing both with our island, go ahead and set the size to the third option (14700m, 48100ft), and to any texture other than Transparent. Synthetic tiles are arranged as blocks of varying (but limited) sizes in a fixed grid. FS Scenery Creator displays the possible block sizes, and makes the closest fit of blocks to the given scenery center. The block boundary will be marked by a thick black rectangle on the editor. You may need to zoom out a few times to see the boundary.</P>
