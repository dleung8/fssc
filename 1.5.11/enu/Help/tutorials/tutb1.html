<H3>The Basics: Lesson 1</H3>

<P><H5>Some Notes:</H5></P>

<P>Different versions of Flight Simulator have slightly different requirements in terms of scenery design. Please pay attention to these differences in the tutorial with the corresponding versions of Flight Simulator that they apply to (FS95, FS98, CFS1, FS2K, CFS2, FS2K2).</P>

<P>Be sure to read through the <A HREF="tutorials\tuta1.html">Getting Acquainted</A> tutorial first.</P>

<P><B>Do not be fooled by the title of this tutorial.</B> The title refers not to the difficulty of this tutorial, but to the steps required to make a minimal scenery in Flight Simulator. Good luck.</P>

<P>This tutorial assumes that you are using the default color scheme of FS Scenery Creator. You might also want to check that you have the correct version of Flight Simulator checked in the Preferences dialog box, as some features are disabled depending on the version selected as it is not supported.</P>

<P><H5>Start up:</H5></P>

<P>If FS Scenery Creator is not open, start the program: Click on your Start Menu, highlight the Programs folder, find Leung Software, and click on FS Scenery Creator.</P>
