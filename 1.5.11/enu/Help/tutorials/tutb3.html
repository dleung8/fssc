<H3>The Basics: Lesson 3</H3>

<P><H5>Necessities</H5></P>

<P>Of course, an airport needs a runway. Create one by right clicking on the editor, selecting "New 2D object", and "Runway". You are now presented with the Runway property page. This is the most complex page in the entire program, but we will look at only a few of the options for now.</P>

<P><H5>Position</H5></P>

<P>In the "Runway" tab, we see the X/Y and Latitude/Longitude. These properties specify the position of the runway (it is currently set to where you clicked on the editor) and the two pairs are linked together: changing one pair changes the other. This is because there are two ways of specifying position: distance from the scenery center (X/Y) or world coordinates. There are instances where it is easier to specify one pair over the other. For now, leave them the way they are.</P>

<P><H5>Rotation</H5></P>

<P>Rotation specifies the direction of the runway. Let's set it to "25°geo" for now. This means that the runway will be facing 25 degrees clockwise from true north. We can also specify "34°mag" which would be approximately the same heading. If you are not familiar with the difference between the geographic north pole, and magnetic north pole, the axis that the earth spins on intersects the geographic north pole, and magnetic compasses point towards the magnetic north pole. The geographic north pole is constant, whereas the magnetic north pole fluctuates slightly over time. Because the compass is used as a primary navigating instrument on an aircraft, the magnetic heading is used when flying, whereas the stability of the geographic heading is more valuable in scenery design.</P>

<P>You can set which convention the program uses, either Geographic, or Magnetic. Internally, the program stores all rotation fields as geographical; this may affect you if you later move the airfield to a different location on the globe. As the geographic to magnetic conversion varies from location to location, the magnetic heading of the same runway will change. If you do not specify a unit, the convention specified in the Preferences dialog box is used. In any case, the degree symbol "°" is optional and can be omitted (i.e. "25geo").</P>

<P><H5>Runway ID</H5></P>

<P>The Runway ID is the designation that is painted on the runway threshold, and is what pilots and controllers use to refer to a runway. By convention, it is usually named by taking the magnetic rotation of the runway, dividing by ten and rounding to the nearest integer. If two runways have the same rotation, the left one has an "L" suffix, and the right one has an "R" suffix. For three runways, the center one has a "C" suffix. The reverse ID is automatically determined for you. Our runway at 34°mag would have an ID of "3".</P>

<P><H5>Markings and Lights</H5></P>

<P>This tab changes the appearance of the markings on the runway and the basic runway lights. The best way to learn about the markings is to actually see them in Flight Simulator. You can see them with the "Runway Gallery" sample files in the Samples folder. To view these files, open the one appropriate for your version of Flight Simulator and then Export them, following the scenery installation instructions later in this tutorial.</P>

<P><H5>Textures</H5></P>

<P>This tab controls the type of surface for the runway. For now, keep the overrun surfaces automatic, and choose any runway surface.</P>

<P><H5>Wrap up</H5></P>

<P>Press OK to create the runway.</P>
