<H3>The Objects: Lesson 3</H3>

<P><H5>The 3D Objects</H5></P>

<P>There are two types of 3D objects: the Building and the Macro. (Macros do not necessarily have to be 3D objects, but they almost always are).</P>

<P><H5>Building:</H5></P>

<P>The building object is a quick way of placing a 3D structure in the scenery. Create a building by right-clicking on the editor, select 3D objects, and Building. Enter the desired width and length of the building, and then select the desired type of building.</P>

<P>Say that you have designed a scenery with a lot of buildings. You might want to allow users to disable some of the buildings so that they have better framerates. The standard way to do this is through Scenery Complexity: this is an option that can be set in Flight Simulator. In FS Scenery Creator, if you set an object to have a complexity of "Dense", this means that the building will be shown only if the user's Scenery Complexity is "Dense" or higher.</P>

<P>Now, click on the Levels tab. Depending on your building type selection, you may be able to change the attributes of different sections of the building; this is controlled by the "Level" dropdown box. You can change the texture of each level, and the number of times the texture is repeated in each direction. A preview is available to show you the results of setting different repeat rates.</P>

<P>Press OK to create the building.</P>

<P><H5>Macros:</H5></P>

<P>The Macro is the most powerful object in the program. With the macro, you have the ability to place objects that are not provided to you by the FS Scenery Creator program. When you create a macro, the first thing to do is to select the type of macro. You can click through the tree of macros, or browse for a file on your hard disk. Many macros of different objects are available on the Internet. Visit the FS Scenery Creator website for some webpage links. Once you have downloaded macros, you can set the "Macro Folder" locations in the Preferences box so that the macros are automatically added to your Macro list.</P>

<P>Macros are sometimes customizable. For example, select Macros\Structure\Observatory, and then click on the Parameters tab. There will be two customizable options: the colors of the two sections. For any parameter that requires a color, click on the text field, and the click on the "Color" tab. You can select textures similarly.</P>

<P>Press OK to create the macro.</P>
