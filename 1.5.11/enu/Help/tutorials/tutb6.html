<P><H5>Save and Export</H5></P>

<P>It is now a good time to save the scenery. Select "Save As" from the File menu to save the file. Select the location and name of the file to save it. This puts the scenery onto disk, so that you can come back to it later. However, the file is saved in FS Scenery Creator's format and it's not ready for Flight Simulator yet. To do this, select "Export Scenery Wizard" from the File menu. The default choices are to create a new file folder structure under the FS\Scenery directory. We will accept that and press "OK".</P>

<P>You now need to tell Flight Simulator that you have a new scenery. Start Flight Simulator if you have not already. Select "Scenery Library" from the World menu. Press OK if a reminder about using the Scenery Library pops up. Make sure "FS World" is now selected and then click the "Files" button. Click "Add". For the scenery area path, type in "=:\=\scenery\SceneryName\SCENERY\*.BGL" (without the quotes). Substitute the file name that you gave your scenery for "SceneryName". The rest of the dialog box should now light up. Enter in your airport name for the "Scenery Area Title". The "Scenery Area Type" should be Local, and the area should be active. Press OK for all of the dialog boxes, and your scenery should now load.</P>

<P>Your scenery should be installed automatically. If the scenery appears different, or elements are missing, the first thing you should do is to close and restart Flight Simulator.</P>

<P><H5>Viewing the scenery</H5></P>

<P>From the World menu, select "Go to Airport". Find your airport by typing or browsing for the name of your airport that you gave earlier (in the Scenery Properties page). Press OK to move to your Airport. Voila!</P>
