<P>Once an object is selected, you can edit its properties. A right-click will bring up the menu (as a shortcut, you can right click on an object to select it and bring up the Editor menu at the same time), and below the Add Objects options, you will find a list of objects that are selected. Selecting one of these will bring up its property page. When multiple objects are selected, there will also be a "Properties" option where you can collectively edit the properties of all the items. Depending on the type of objects selected, you may be presented with a specialized property page, or a generic page where you can only edit the position properties.</P>

<P>If you want to change the position of selected objects, just click on any of the selected object and drag them to the new location. All of the other selected objects will move the same distance. A new feature of FS Scenery Creator is that if you drag objects near the edge of the screen, the program will automatically scroll the editor at small intervals. (This will also happen when you are making a selection rectangle.)</P>

<P>You can use the following shortcut keys. Pressing F4 will open up the selected object's property page with the first tab selected. F5 will open up the page with the second tab selected, and F6, F7, and F8 will open up the page with the third, fourth, and fifth tab selected respectively. If multiple objects are selected, the multiple objects property page will be shown.</P>
