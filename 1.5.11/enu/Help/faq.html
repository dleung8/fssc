<P>This section of the help file will expand as more questions are asked. If you have any questions, please send them to <A HREF="mailto:fsschelp@yahoo.com">fsschelp@yahoo.com</A> or through the Instant Messenger services. They may make it on this page!</P>

<P><B>My aircraft bounces and jumps when taxiing on the scenery (FS2000, FS2002). How do I fix it?</B></P>

<P>You must apply a different surface ground property for your area. In FS2000 this is only possible by setting an "invisible" runway, using the "Invisible" texture. Just make this runway as large and wide as the area you wish to have a smooth surface. In FS2002, you should use the Surface Area object with the Smooth attribute.</P>

<P><B>Can I load airports in Flight Simulator into FS Scenery Creator?</B></P>

<P>FS Scenery Creator does not yet support this feature. However, you can place objects accurately by using the latitude and longitude fields of any object.</P>

<P><B>Can I add objects on top of an existing airport?</B></P>

<P>Yes. This is by default, you do not have to do anything special.</P>

<P><B>So how do I delete a default airport?</B></P>

<P>Check the "Visual Scenery" box in the Exclusion tab of the Scenery Properties box.</P>

<P><B>My plane is stuck on the ground and I can't move it. What's wrong? (Flight Simulator 2000 and above)</B></P>

<P>You need to level your scenery area. Use the Flat Area object to set a uniform altitude, In FS2002, use a surface area with the "Smooth" attribute in addition to the Flat Area.</P>

<P><B>I am seeing funny lines from my taxiways. How do I fix it?</B></P>

<P>If you have any sections that overlap back on itself (near 180 degree angle), you need to turn off one of the sections. Select the point and change the Line Style attribute to Invisible. This is the expected behavior, as the same thing happens in Flight Simulator.</P>

<P><B>Are my old FS Scenery Creator files compatible with the new version?</B></P>

<P>FS Scenery Creator files from Version 1.1.x and 1.2.x can be loaded into Version 1.5. Any missing information is filled with default values. However, files created in later versions cannot be loaded into previous versions. Notes: Flatten areas generated in Version 1.1.x are not loaded. Lines that have both solid and lighted dot sections are not supported anymore and are loaded as solid lines. City and Fuel Area objects are now supported through Macros and are loaded as such.</P>

<P><B>I am loading my Airport files into FS Scenery Creator. What should I expect to happen?</B></P>

<P>The conversion process is not perfect. Dynamic Objects and adjustable macros currently cannot be loaded. If the file contains any macros that were bundled with Airport, Airport must be installed for the macros to load correctly. The rotation values of Runways and Menu Entries may be slightly incorrect due to the lack of precision of magnetic variation in earlier versions of Airport (2.1 and early 2.6 Builds).</P>

<P><B>I am designing scenery for FS2000, CFS2, FS2002, or above, and have normal, night, winter, and spring bitmaps. How do I apply them in FS Scenery Creator?</B></P>

<P>See the help entry on textures.</P>

<P><B>The scenery generation is giving me "Inst_81: unknown command" errors. How do I solve this?</B></P>

<P>SCASM 2.5/2.8 does not support this command anymore. Open the macro file in a text editor that has a replace function. Replace all instances of "Inst_81" to "Smoothing". </P>

<P><B>This section does not solve my problem(s). What should I do?</B></P>

<P>See the Contact Information page on how to get in touch with me. </P>

<P><B>There are some features that I would like to be in FS Scenery Creator. What should I do?</B></P>

<P>See the Contact Information page on how to get in touch with me. </P>
