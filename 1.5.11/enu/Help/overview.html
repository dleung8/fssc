<H3>Overview of the Program</H3>

<P>FS Scenery Creator is a powerful, easy-to-use, graphical scenery designer for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It features OpenGL drawing for a realistic bird's eye-view of your scenery, and an easy point-and-click interface. When ready for more fine-tuning, just open up a property page, and choose from a myriad of features and options.  FS Scenery Creator also supports macros in all standard formats (VOD, A&SD, FSSC, and Airport), which can greatly extend the boundaries of scenery design. FS Scenery Creator is an international-aware application featuring translations for property pages and help files to several languages of the world, and support for different standard units of measure.</P>

<P>The Help Desk is available for most of the year to try to answer all your questions about scenery design or about FS Scenery Creator. Live one-on-one help is available through the Internet's messenger services during some times of the day and year, and e-mail support is always available.</P>
