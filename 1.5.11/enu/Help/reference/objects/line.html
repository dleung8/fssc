<H3>Line Object</H3>

<P>At its most basic function, the line object draws a line in the Flight Simulator world. This can be used to define taxiway centerlines, or elevated power lines. However, the most powerful feature of the line is that you can link a <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> or a <A HREF="reference\objects\macro.html">macro</A> with a line, and have the linked object be repeated at regular intervals. To do this, simply select an object type, edit its properties and type in a spacing factor.</P>

<P>Lines are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
