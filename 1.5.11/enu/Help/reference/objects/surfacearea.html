<H3>Surface Area Object</H3>

<P>A surface area can either define a platform (such as those for helipads), or the ground type (runway, grass, water). For designing airports that do not exist in the Flight Simulator 2002 default world, you must use a Surface Area with "Smooth" type to have the area landable.</P>
