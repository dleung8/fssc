<H3>Taxiway Line Object</H3>

<P>The taxiway line object allows you to define FS2002 style taxiway markings. You can select from seven different styles of taxiway lines. If you want curved corners, set the arc radius field to greater than 0. To understand the arc radius parameter, imagine a circle with the specified radius. Align the circle so that it is tangent to both lines that form the corner. The smaller arc of the circle now approximately forms the curve of the resulting taxiway line.</P>

<P>Taxiway lines are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
