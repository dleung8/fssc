<H3>Menu Entry Object</H3>

<P>The menu entry object positions aircraft at specific points inside your scenery. The entries created by the Menu Entry object will appear in the "Scenery 6.0 and before" section of the Airport and Facility Directory in Flight Simulator.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can also provide starting locations for your airport in the Airport and Facility Directory. In the Runway property page, check "Airport Facility Entry", and starting locations for both ends of the runways will be automatically created for you.</P>
