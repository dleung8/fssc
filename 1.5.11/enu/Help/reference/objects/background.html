<H3>Background Image Object</H3>

<P>A background image allows you to overlay image files over the editor to get an accurate placement of objects, or when the visible property is checked, it allows you to place the image as-is in the Flight Simulator world.</P>

<P>To place the image accurately, you must either have the scale of the image in meters per pixel (or some other compatible distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">unit</A>) or the coordinates of two opposite corners and the rotation of the image.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> If you are placing a visible bitmap, FS Scenery Creator may generate a converted bitmap in the destination texture directory in a format compatible with Flight Simulator. If you are redistributing your scenery, be sure to include this file.</P>
