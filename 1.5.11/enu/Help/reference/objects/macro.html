<H3>Macro Object</H3>

<P>The macro is able to extend FS Scenery Creator beyond its predefined objects. Macros are developed by hobbyists around the world, and usually come in one of several standard formats which can be read by FS Scenery Creator. A macro is usually a complex object with intricate textures and shapes; for example, a tree, a building, or an airplane. They may provide parameters that can be used to customize the object (such as the <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A> or the dimensions of the object). These can be set in the third tab of the Macro property page.</P>

<P>Because the use of "includes" is obsolete, FS Scenery Creator does not provide direct support for them. However, if you do have occasion to use one, simply use the macro object with the file name of the include. The include will simply ignore any parameters passed into it.</P>
