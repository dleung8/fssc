<H3>Building Object</H3>

<P>The building can be used to make houses, office buildings, or airport terminals. Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, you can use the advanced building style to mix and match many different textures. An advanced building has 4 different levels: the lobby, the floors, the penthouse, and the roof, and each level can be customized in terms of height, texture, and texture stretching factor. You can preview the textures and the scaling that you've chosen using the building editor.</P>

<P>Besides the default four-sided flat roof style, you can also choose the pyramid, sloped, or n-sided styles.</P>
