<H3>Flat Area Object</H3>

<P>A flat area defines a level surface for your airport, and is a must for any airfield that is not already defined in some way in the Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2 default world. For Flight Simulator 98, Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, use <A HREF="reference\scenery.html">Synthetic Scenery</A>. For Flight Simulator 2002, you use a Flat Area to set the desired altitude, and a <A HREF="reference\objects\surfacearea.html">Surface Area</A> in addition to the flat area if the scenery area was a body of water in the default scenery.</P>

<P>Choose from two different ways to flatten your scenery:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Flatten Switch (scenery.cfg):</B> These are several lines of instructions in the FS\scenery.cfg file that tell Flight Simulator to flatten a given area. This method is limited to 1 flat area per scenery area. Unless there is a good reason to do so, use the Area16N method instead.
<LI><B>Area16N:</B> This is the recommended method for Flight Simulator 2000, 2002 and Combat Flight Simulator 2. A separate BGL file is generated with the flat area commands and there are no practical limitations on the number and the size of each flat area. Each flat area is surrounded by slopes to blend in with the surrounding altitudes.
</UL>

<P>Flat Areas are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
