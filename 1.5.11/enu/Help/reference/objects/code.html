<H3>SCASM Code Object</H3>

<P>The SCASM code object is used to write raw code in the Scenery Assembler language in FS Scenery Creator. This object is present to provide the import feature with a default object, and is rarely used in actual scenery design. The documentation for the SCASM language is given in the FSSC\Scasm subfolder.</P>
