<H3>ATIS Object</H3>

<P>An ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information System) sends out information regarding flight conditions around an airport. The text is limited to 255 characters. Several escape sequences are available to shorten the message to within the allowable limit, or to insert actual weather conditions. These sequences are available by clicking the Insert button under the text field. This object is not available in FS2000 or above as it has been replaced with a voice version which is no longer part of the scenery design language.</P>
