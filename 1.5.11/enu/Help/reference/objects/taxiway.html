<H3>Taxiway Object</H3>

<P>The taxiway links a runway to the terminal. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a taxiway by a series of connected points. For advanced users, it may be somewhat beneficial for speed in using the discontinuity property (see <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">point object</A>) to design an entire airport's taxiway network with one taxiway object. Taxiways may optionally be lined with blue lights, and have a centerline. For greater control over the placement of taxiways, designers have used a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">polygon</A> with dotted blue lights to simulate a taxiway.</P>

<P>Taxiways are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
