<H3>Runway Object</H3>

<P>The runway is the basic scenery element of flight simulation and defines the airport. Most, if not all, sceneries that you will design will involve placing one or more runways.</P>

<P>There are several properties that are specific to each end of the runway. For scenery design purposes, the near end of the runway is defined to be the direction that is set in the Properties tab, and the far end is the reverse end of the runway. The instrument landing system (ILS) can also be set for each end of the runway.</P>

<P>To do a runway that is invisible but provides a landing surface (commonly called an invisible runway), select "Invisible" for the Runway Surface in the Textures tab. To not create a runway at all (for example, to create just an ILS), check the "Runway Visible" box in the "Runway" tab.</P>
