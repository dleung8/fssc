<H3>Road Object</H3>

<P>Roads in Flight Simulator are for decorative purposes only. Its usage in FS Scenery Creator is similar to a <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>. In FS Scenery Creator, you define a road by a series of connected points. Roads may optionally be filled with moving car lights at night.</P>

<P>Roads are defined by two or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
