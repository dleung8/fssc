<H3>Polygon Object</H3>

<P>The polygon defines the texture of the ground. A polygon may be associated with a <A HREF="reference\properties\texture.html">texture</A> or a <A HREF="reference\properties\color.html">color</A>. The sides may optionally be dotted with lights. Polygons are primarily used to give the overall appearance of the ground, such as grass, dirt, concrete, or city streets. A polygon, however, does not define a landing area for an airplane. To do this, see the topic on <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat areas</A>, and on <A HREF="reference\objects\surfacearea.html">surface areas</A>.</P>

<P>Polygons are defined by three or more <A HREF="reference\objects\point.html">points</A> that can be dragged independently.</P>
