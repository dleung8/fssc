<H3>Point Object</H3>

<P>The Point defines the shape of a parent object which includes the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiway.html">taxiway</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\road.html">road</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\river.html">river</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\line.html">line</A>, <A HREF="reference\objects\taxiwayline.html">Taxiway Line</A>, and <A HREF="reference\objects\flatarea.html">flat area</A>.</P>

<P>Besides the <A HREF="reference\properties\position.html">position</A> properties, the point also has a type property. The following choices may not be present for certain types of objects:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Visible:</B> A line (or taxiway, etc.) is drawn to the next point.
<LI><B>Invisible:</B> A discontinuity exists between the point and the next point, i.e. no line is drawn.
<LI><B>Dotted:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals to the next point.
<LI><B>Taxiway:</B> Dots are drawn at regular intervals along this edge of the polygon.
</UL>

<P>Points can be created by clicking on a line of the parent object that you want to create a point in, or by pressing the Insert key. Points are deleted using the Delete key, or by using the Delete option from the <A HREF="ui\menus\edit.html">Edit menu</A>. If the number of points fall below the allowable limit, the parent object is automatically deleted for you.</P>

<P>The maximum number of points that can be created are: 80 for Combat Flight Simulator 1 and below, 2000 for Flight Simulator 2000 and above, and 30 for a Flat Area that uses a flatten switch.</P>

<P>The Z property can be used to create different effects, such as slanted polygons. However, this should only be changed by the most advanced users.</P>
