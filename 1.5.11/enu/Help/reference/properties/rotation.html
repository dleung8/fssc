<H3>Rotation</H3>

<P>Rotation (called heading in previous versions of FS Scenery Creator) determines the orientation of an object. It is only available in some objects such as the building and the runway. Because the magnetic rotation value of the same physical direction may vary from year to year, FS Scenery Creator stores all rotations in the geographic measurement which is fixed. (However, you can set FS Scenery Creator to display rotations in magnetic form in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>). As discussed in the <A HREF="ui\units.html">units of measure</A> topic, you can enter rotations in either format.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> FS Scenery Creator uses the magnetic variation table of the currently selected Flight Simulator version to determine the geographic to magnetic conversions.</P>
