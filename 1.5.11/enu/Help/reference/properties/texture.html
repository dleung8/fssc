<H3>Texture</H3>

<P>Textures fill and shade most of the Flight Simulator world. Most objects use some form of texturing to decorate the object. In FS Scenery Creator, you can choose from a set list of textures for some objects, such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\building.html">building</A> and <A HREF="reference\objects\runway.html">runway</A> objects, or from a list of textures on your file system such as the <A HREF="reference\objects\polygon.html">polygon</A> object.</P>

<P>Beginning with Flight Simulator 2000, different textures can be used for different times of the day, and for different seasons. These textures need to be named in a special naming convention so that they can be detected by Flight Simulator. The following list summarizes the naming convention:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Normal: base.bmp
<LI>Night: base_LM.bmp
<LI>Spring: base_SP.bmp
<LI>Fall: base_FA.bmp
<LI>Winter: base_WI.bmp
<LI>Hard winter: base_HW.bmp
</UL>

<P>Unfortunately, most bitmaps cannot be used as-is by Flight Simulator, and must first be processed by a bitmap editing program such as BMP2000, DxtBMP, or Microsoft's ImageTool.</P>
