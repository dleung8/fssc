<P>While texturing has gained much more importance in the past few years as graphics engines have become much faster, colors are still an important part of the scenery. FS Scenery Creator provides a large palette of colors that can be accessed from the property pages of objects that support it. You may choose from the basic colors, or the night-illuminated colors supported in all versions of Flight Simulator, or if you are designing for Flight Simulator 2000 or higher, you can specify any red-green-blue color to generate one of more than 16 million colors. You can also choose from 16 levels of transparency (from clear to opaque) to control shading, and you can make any color (not just the night palette colors) night persistent.</P>
