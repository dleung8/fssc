<H3>Position Properties (X/Y, and Latitude/Longitude)</H3>

<P>The position properties determine where the object is placed in the world. There are two ways to locate an object: either by describing the distance from a reference point (the X and Y properties) or by an absolute position (the latitude and longitude properties). Both sets of properties can be used in FS Scenery Creator.</P>

<P>The X and Y values can be entered in any distance <A HREF="ui\units.html">units</A> and are relative to the scenery center point.</P>

<P>The latitude and longitude values can be entered in decimal format (which is the more accurate of the two), or the fractional minutes format which is the default format used in Flight Simulator. You can, however, change this setting in the <A HREF="ui\options\index.html">Preferences Window</A>, and the change will be reflected the next time you start Flight Simulator. Regardless of the current setting, FS Scenery Creator can detect and convert either format into X/Y values.</P>

<P>Graphically, you can change the positional properties by dragging an object around the editor. The current position of your mouse is displayed in the statusbar in both X/Y and Latitude/Longitude form.</P>
